THE STUDY SERVES TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THEORETICAL RESEARCH OF RHETORIC AND THE NEEDS OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION PRACTITIONERS BY IDENTIFYING THE MEANS OF PERSUASION THAT CAN BE USED BY ONLINE CROWD FUNDING ENTREPRENEURS. METHOD: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THIRTEEN CROWD FUNDING PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS POSTED ON A MAJOR WEB SITE-WWW.KICKSTARTER.COM-WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC RHETORICAL TECHNIQUES VIA TEXT CODING. THE SAMPLE INCLUDED THE MOST-FUNDED PROJECTS TO DATE, ONE FROM EACH OF THE THIRTEEN PROJECT CATEGORIES ON KICKSTARTER. ARISTOTLE'S CONCEPT OF ETHOS, PATHOS, AND LOGOS SERVED AS A BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING A MORE DETAILED CLASSIFICATION OF RHETORICAL MEANS OF PERSUASION USED IN THE PROJECTS. RESULTS: THE MOST-FUNDED PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CONTAIN ALL THREE TYPES OF RHETORICAL APPEALS (ETHOS, PATHOS, AND LOGOS), SUBDIVIDED INTO A TOTAL OF TWELVE SPECIFIC SUBTYPES MOST COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED IN THE DESCRIPTIONS FROM THE SAMPLE. THE SUBTYPE DEFINITIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND REFINED OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL REVIEWS. CONCLUSION: THE RESEARCH DATA MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CREATE A ``RHETORICAL PROFILE'' OF A SUCCESSFUL CROWD FUNDING PROJECT DESCRIPTION REPRESENTING A SUMMARY OF THE RHETORICAL TECHNIQUES IDENTIFIED DURING THE STUDY. ALTHOUGH THIS SUMMARY REFLECTS A HYPOTHETICAL ALL-INCLUSIVE CASE, IT CAN BE USED AS A BENCHMARK WHEN DRAFTING CROWD FUNDING PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS.

CHANGING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DESIGNER AND USER, THIS NEW FORM OF DATA DESIGN HAS INTENSIFIED THE AFFECTIVE IMPACT OF DATA DISPLAYS BY ELICITING EMOTIONS RANGING FROM EXCITEMENT AND EMPATHY TO ANXIETY AND FEAR. METHODS: THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY SOURCES TO BUILD ITS CASE. IT GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF EMOTIONAL APPEALS IN THE RHETORICAL TRADITION, FROM ARISTOTLE TO MODERN THEORISTS LIKE GEORGE CAMPBELL, WHO EMPHASIZED SENSORY RESPONSES THROUGH PERSONALIZATION AND PROXIMITY. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES AN HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF PATHOS APPEALS IN DATA DESIGN DURING THE LATER NINETEENTH CENTURY AND THE SHIFT TO MODERNIST MINIMALISM IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLES FROM COMPANIES, NONPROFITS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND INDIVIDUAL DESIGNERS ILLUSTRATE HOW DATA VISUALIZATION AROUSES EMOTION. RESULTS: EMOTIONAL APPEALS DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON COLOR AND DESIGN NOVELTY, WHICH, BY APPEALING LARGELY TO THE SENSES, FOSTERED EMOTIONAL RESPONSES SUCH AS EXCITEMENT AND CURIOSITY. CONTEMPORARY DATA VISUALIZATION MAKES SIMILAR EMOTIONAL APPEALS THROUGH THE USE OF COLOR, NOVELTY, AND MULTIMODAL FEATURES; HOWEVER, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ALSO ALLOWS DESIGNERS TO APPEAL TO THE EMOTIONS BY PERSONALIZING DISPLAYS THROUGH INTERACTIVITY, SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PROXIMITY, AND AESTHETIC AND EXPRESSIVE ELEMENTS. CONCLUSION: PATHOS (EMOTIONAL) APPEALS HAVE BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF CONTEMPORARY DATA VISUALIZATION, LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE MULTIMODAL AND INTERACTIVE AFFORDANCES OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. DESIGNERS WHO UNDERSTAND THIS DIMENSION OF DATA DESIGN CAN DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THEIR DISPLAYS MORE ENGAGING, HUMANE, AND USABLE.\"\n[6] \"ANALOGICAL REASONING HAS LONG BEEN AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE PRODUCTION OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, YET MANY SCIENTISTS REMAIN HESITANT TO FULLY ENDORSE (OR EVEN ADMIT) ITS USE. AS THE TEACHERS OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL WRITERS, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH THEM TO USE ANALOGY WITHOUT THEIR WRITING BECOMING ``OVERLY INDUCTIVE,'' AS ARISTOTLE WARNED. TO THAT END, I HERE OFFER AN ANALYSIS OF AN EXAMPLE OF THE EFFECTIVE USE OF ANALOGY IN RODNEY BROOKS'S ``INTELLIGENCE WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.'' IN THIS ARTICLE, BROOKS PROVIDES A MODEL FOR INCORPORATING THESE TOOLS INTO AN ARGUMENT BY BUILDING FOUR OF THEM INTO AN ENTHYMEME THAT CLEARLY ORGANIZES HIS ARGUMENT.
