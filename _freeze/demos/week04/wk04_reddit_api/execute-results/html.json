If you'd like to learn how to use purrr's map functions, [this demonstration](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/index.html) may be helpful.   \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# depending on the number of thread URLs and comments on each, this may take a while...we could make a loop and add a pause, but let's just create separate requests manually for now\n\n#threads_content_1 <- get_thread_content(tw_urls$url[0:30])\n#threads_content_2 <- get_thread_content(tw_urls$url[31:60])\n#threads_content_3 <- get_thread_content(tw_urls$url[90:107])\n\n#head(threads_content_1$comments, n=5)\n```\n:::\n",
