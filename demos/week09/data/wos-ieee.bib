Abstract = {Introduction: This article describes our work to build an undergraduate
   program in user experience centered on empathy, access, and humanism.
   About the case: This teaching case is focused on how we situated
   accessibility (a11y, a numeronym) at the core of our undergraduate
   degree. Based on our program values, industry experience, and market
   need, we aimed to build a program that focused on accessibility.
   Situating the case: Our work is situated in the literature of technical
   communication, specifically on accessibility as social justice design.
   Focusing primarily on issues of pedagogy, we discuss the market need for
   this work, both inside the academy and within industry.
   Methods/approach: Through our experimental work applied within the
   program's framework, we built a foundational course, launched an
   intensive short program (study away), and developed opportunities for
   student knowledge sharing on the local, regional, and national levels.
   Results/discussion: Focusing on accessibility gave our students a strong
   foundation and broader connections with outside partners focused on user
   experience. Conclusions: Placing accessibility at the center of the
   mission, scholars and practitioners alike can address these concerns and
   keep their commitment to creating user experiences centered on shared
   values of equity, sustainability, and usability. With the rising need
   for accessibility specialists in the workforce and structured programs
   in academia, this article describes how technical communicators can
   develop these foundations in their own organizations.},

Title = {The Effects of Different Parts of the Annual Report on Potential
   Investors' Attitudes Towards the Company and on the Corporate Reputation},

Abstract = {Research problem: Both the function and the appearance of annual reports
   have changed over the last few decades. These multimodal reports now
   include many types of information that serve different functions. In
   this study, the effects of several information types on stakeholders'
   attitudes toward annual reports and the companies that published them
   are measured. Literature review: Not much is known about how
   stakeholders read annual reports. The literature is not conclusive on
   the relative importance of several information types in these reports.
   Most studies investigate the impact of part of the information in annual
   reports and ignore the combined impact of the information types. Whether
   the potential investors are more affected by the financial review, the
   future strategy narrative or by pictures, such as a picture of the CEO,
   is unknown. Methodology: An experiment (2 2 2 between subjects design)
   was conducted to test the effects of a good financial review versus a
   poor one, a good future strategy versus a poor one and a picture of the
   CEO smiling versus that with a serious facial expression. The effects on
   potential stakeholders' attitudes toward the information, on their
   attitudes toward investing in the company, and on their perceptions of
   the corporate reputation are measured. Results and conclusion: The
   results show significant effects of all three information types. A good
   financial review, a good future strategy, and a serious facial
   expression have beneficial effects on the potential stakeholders'
   attitudes and on the corporate reputation. More important, however, the
   results show that the information types should be aligned with each
   other. A smiling facial expression, for example, is only beneficial if
   the content of the other information types is good.},

Title = {The Role of Communication Complexity in Adaptive Contextualization},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},

Number = {2},
Pages = {98-112},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research problem: Adding contextual information to a core message has
   been shown to be critical in improving communication quality, especially
   in computer mediated communication. This paper models how people
   contextualize messages in the face of changing communication complexity.
   Research question: Can changes in communication complexity that occur
   during the communication process explain and predict contextualization?
   Literature review: Theories of human communication and studies of
   computer supported collaboration suggest that communication complexity
   reflects potentially problematic conditions resulting from 1) the
   difference in perspective and context held by the collaborators; 2) the
   incompatibility between the message representation and the way it is
   interpreted and used by the receiver; and 3) the intensity of
   information exchanged between communicators. We use this definition as a
   basis of for developing a measure of cognitive communication complexity.
   The literature further suggests that higher communication complexity
   induces higher contextualization. Methodology: First, we conducted a
   pilot study to develop and validate measures of communication
   complexity. Second, we conducted a laboratory experiment, in which 258
   participants working in pairs collaborated on a sixteen-step assembly
   task. They used a tailored system that structured each message as core
   (the essence of the message) and context (additional information that
   explains the core and the sender's perspective). We used unbalanced
   panel data analysis to examine the repeated measures of
   contextualization and communication complexity associated with each step
   of the task. Results and discussion: We found that collaborators respond
   to changes in communication complexity at the expense of higher
   collaborative effort. We offer a cost-benefit framework in which, at the
   step level, people contextualize to reduce the communication complexity,
   and at the task level, they additionally consider the impact of
   contextualization on task performance. The main limitation of this study
   was the need to structure the communication between collaborators, to
   control and measure contextualization. Future research can adapt and
   extend our measure of communication complexity to less structured
   communication.},

Title = {Electronic Media Variety and Virtual Team Performance: The Mediating

Abstract = {Research problem: Much of the research on electronic communication media
   so far has been characterized by a focus on the impact that specific
   media may have on individuals and teams, as opposed to the impact that
   multiple media, when used in combination, may have on individuals and
   teams. Research questions: (1) Does a high degree of media variety
   facilitate the implementation of team mechanisms for coping with task
   complexity? (2) Does the degree of implementation of team mechanisms for
   coping with task complexity positively influence team performance?
   Literature review: Based on a focused literature review, we develop a
   new set of propositions relating media variety and team performance,
   which we tested in the context of teams engaged in new product
   development. Methodology: Data from 290 new product development teams in
   66 organizations located in the Northeastern US were analyzed through
   partial least squares-based structural equation modeling. The analysis
   was conducted with the software WarpPLS 2.0. Results and discussion: The
   results of the analysis suggest that a high degree of electronic
   communication media variety facilitates the implementation of task
   complexity coping mechanisms, such as coordination activities, in new
   product development teams. This, in turn, seems to lead to significant
   gains in team efficiency and effectiveness in those teams. The results
   also suggest that while electronic communication media variety plays an
   important facilitation role, by facilitating coordination activities, it
   has a much less pronounced direct effect on team efficiency and
   effectiveness. In other words, in the absence of task complexity coping
   mechanisms, such as coordination activities, a high degree of media
   variety may not be very useful for teams carrying out complex tasks such
   as new product development.},

Title = {Designing and Developing Questionnaires for Translation Tutorial},

Abstract = {Problem: Questionnaires are a popular method used by global companies to
   gain understanding or assess various aspects of their businesses.
   However, using a questionnaire across cultures requires extra effort in
   translating it into the target language(s) and culture(s) because a good
   questionnaire developed in one language/culture may not necessarily
   ``travel well{''} {[}1] across cultures due to differences in meaning
   and interpretation. This tutorial synthesizes the extant research on
   cross-cultural communication and surveys, and provides guidance in
   preparing cross-cultural questionnaires. Concepts: Translation affects
   the design and development of questionnaires to be used across cultures
   in these ways: (1) It affects the theoretical concepts to be studied:
   indicators-questions about concrete elements that can be measured and
   constructs-a series of questions about abstract elements that cannot be
   measured directly and essentially represent an underlying concept.
   Constructs must be adapted into a specific cultural context to achieve
   accuracy in measurements. (2) Differences in the contexts-the overall
   cross-cultural research context (the setting and the purpose) and the
   cultural context (the participants and their cultural background) of the
   study-affect translation because concepts in the source culture might be
   applied differently or not exist in the target cultures. (3) Translation
   might unintentionally introduce bias by inadvertently changing the
   perceived meanings of terms and questions-creating bias in constructs,
   on individual items on the questionnaire, and in its administration. (4)
   Translation might affect equivalence of terms in the source and
   translated versions, including linguistic equivalence (that is, wording
   of items), semantics (meaning of a phrase or concept), and grammar and
   syntax. Suggestions: Given these concepts, consider the following items
   when translating questionnaires: (1) accurately adapt or adopt questions
   from existing instruments, (2) make sure that you adapt the language to
   suit the situation, (3) hire translators who understand research
   processes, (4) use the decentering approach (a process in which
   translators move back and forth amongst the languages, checking for
   cultural and linguistic accuracy) when preparing the actual translation,
   and (5) assess your overall translated questionnaire. The questionnaire
   assessment model is a resource for guiding the assessment.},

Abstract = {To better understand how individuals, groups, and organizations can use
   information systems more effectively, a research approach closer to the
   level of social interchange is required. A multiple-level, sustainable,
   information-technology (IT) learning framework, rooted in patterns of
   practice and constructed by participatory action research, offers an
   alternative methodology for investigating sustainable strategies of IT
   learning. The framework evolved from concrete instances of IT learning
   across organizational case studies. A patterns-based analysis of the
   ethnographic data enabled the examination of informal IT learning in
   community contexts and the identification of IT interventions more
   likely to produce successful learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {A recent International Civil Aviation Organization initiative mandates
   that pilots and air-traffic controllers operating on international
   routes demonstrate adequate English-language proficiency for successful
   communication. The Versant Aviation English Test was developed to serve
   this purpose. It is a fully automated speaking and listening performance
   test, where administration of the test tasks and scoring of the
   candidates' responses are computerized. We argue that not only do
   candidates engage in cognitively and linguistically appropriate
   interactions, but that computer-generated scores and human ratings are
   consistent (r = 0.94), enabling valid score-based decisions to be made
   on the basis of automated language testing.},

Abstract = {As virtual teams become more and more important In organizations,
   understanding how to improve virtual team relational development and
   meeting outcomes is vital to project success. The objective of this
   study was to investigate how the dialogue technique that facilitated
   building of shared understanding in virtual teams can be used to enhance
   virtual team relational development and decision outcomes in a Chinese
   cultural context. The results from an experiment demonstrate that the
   adopted dialogue technique can indeed help team members develop their
   team relations and enhance their perceived team meeting outcomes.
   Video-conferencing virtual teams with shared mental models may be
   engaged as effectively is traditional face-to-face teams. Moreover this
   study reveals that the dialogue technique can enhance face-to-face team
   outcomes. Therefore, the findings of this study have both theoretical
   and practical implications for helping teams develop shared
   understanding of effective communication and enhance decision-making
   outcomes in the Chinese cultural context.},

Abstract = {Several information systems' and computer-mediated communication studies
   in the literature measure user's perceptions of email. The user's
   perceptions of email were used to develop and validate the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM). While a user's perceptions of email play an
   important role in literature, very few studies have focused solely on
   developing a construct for measuring these perceptions. In this paper we
   develop a construct to measure an individual's perceptions of email as a
   medium for electronic communication in organizations. Using a survey of
   management and nonmanagement employees in Northeastern US, we
   empirically test our theoretical construct. The results of our research
   indicate that an individual's perceptions of email are a
   multidimensional construct with two dimensions: the individual level
   dimension and the organizational level. At an individual level, a
   person's perceptions may be impacted by email's role in improving
   productivity, supporting team work, and providing global reach. At an
   organizational level a person's perceptions may be impacted by email's
   role in making an organization vulnerable to viruses, exposing
   proprietary information, and/or encouraging unprofessional and illegal
   behavior.},

Title = {Revisiting SL in TPC Through Social Justice and Intercultural

Abstract = {Background: This article reports on survey-based research of technical
   and professional communication (TPC) teachers and administrators,
   illustrating how these participants implement social justice and
   intercultural communication pedagogies in service learning (SL).
   Literature review: We situate this research in relation to existing
   scholarship about SL in TPC, SL and social justice, and SL as it
   intersects with intercultural communication. Research question: How do
   technical and professional communication teachers and administrators
   across the US infuse their SL pedagogies with social justice and
   intercultural communication theories in practice? Research methodology:
   Using purposive sampling, we surveyed 55 TPC teachers and administrators
   about their experiences with and attitudes toward social justice and
   intercultural communication in SL. Results/discussion: We identify what
   courses are reported as sites of SL projects as well as participants'
   self-reported perceptions about social justice in SL. In addition, we
   outline four themes related to the application of social justice and
   intercultural communication theories to SL: activities, constraints,
   points of resistance, and goals and outcomes. Conclusion: We conclude
   with recommendations for TPC administrators and programs, and by briefly
   discussing implications for TPC practitioners and future directions for
   research.},

Abstract = {Introduction: This tutorial offers technical and professional
   communication (TPC) professionals a heuristic designed to support more
   just data practices. Key concepts: Understanding how data contribute to
   discussions of public problems matters, especially in times of crisis
   during which multiply marginalized communities are disproportionately
   affected. Critical Data Studies clarifies how data practice and
   priorities emerging from various domains of power exacerbate structural
   inequalities. If we recognize, reveal, and reject data practices that
   cast data as if they were neutral or fixed, we can ensure that our data
   practices as TPC professionals are more just. Key lessons: 1. Recognize
   that data are socially constructed and often incomplete. 2. Reveal the
   overarching social, political, cultural, and economic conditions that
   shape data collection and by extension, data itself. 3. Reject faulty or
   biased processes for data interpretation and analysis that perpetuate
   inequality. Implications for practice: By acknowledging the relationship
   between data and context, we can promote better, more just data
   practices, preparing TPC professionals to work alongside community
   stakeholders in intersectional coalitions and challenging the conditions
   that lead to unjust data that fail to represent, over-represent, or
   blatantly misrepresent the realities of vulnerable communities.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The use of virtual teams (VTs) has been growing
   steadily since the late 1990s. However, there is disagreement on how the
   virtuality of a team impacts the relationship of trust and team
   effectiveness. Some studies have suggested that the operationalization
   of the virtuality has been simplistic, with most researchers treating
   virtuality as a binary state. Recently, some researchers have sought to
   explore more complex conceptualizations of virtuality. Research
   question: How do dimensions of virtuality impact the relationship
   between intrateam trust and team effectiveness for virtual teams?
   Literature review: Researchers have been studying the dynamics of VTs
   for more than 20 years; however, the prevailing measure of virtuality is
   unidimensional. Following others, we employ a multidimensional measure
   of virtuality to model three interactions with the relationship between
   intrateam trust and team effectiveness. By reviewing relevant team
   effectiveness, intrateam trust, and virtuality literature, we build a
   model of team effectiveness based on three dimensions of virtuality.
   Methodology: A total of 230 subjects on 73 project teams were asked to
   record their interactions while working on a complex case assignment,
   allowing us to measure the three dimensions of virtuality. Results:
   Findings indicate that although Distance Virtuality and Member
   Virtuality moderate the relationship between intrateam trust and
   effectiveness, Time Worked Virtually does not, supporting the
   proposition that virtuality is a multidimensional construct. Conclusion:
   Differential findings support the multidimensional conceptualization of
   virtuality. We discuss several implications of our findings for virtual
   team managers, while paying attention to recent changes in team
   composition resulting from shelter-in-place orders associated with the
   COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Under the influence of economic globalization, many
   enterprises are seeking more markets in developing countries, and more
   Chinese business expatriates are being sent to work in host countries.
   This study explores Chinese business expatriates' communication
   experience and identity work in three African countries, and their
   perceptions of the functions of English or the local language in
   transnational business communication. About the case: This article
   explores the following research questions: 1. How do Chinese business
   expatriates experience their cultural and national identity when using a
   foreign working language in a host country? 2. How do Chinese business
   expatriates evaluate the functions of a foreign language in their
   transnational communication? 3. What suggestions can be provided for
   future business expatriates and their transnational/globalizing
   companies? Situating the case: The process of identity construction and
   business expatriates' identity work in a host space are interpreted in
   the context of Hofstede and Hofstede's acculturation curve. Other key
   concepts related to transnational business communication, including
   third space as defined by Bhabha, are also addressed. Methods/approach:
   Using a case study approach, the researchers examine four participants'
   transnational business communication experiences and interpret their
   identity work through the data collected in the form of interviews.
   Results/discussion: The researchers find that the business expatriates
   realized the importance of English or local language communication
   competence in a transnational business space, although they still kept
   their Chinese cultural and national identity. Conclusions: This study
   contributes to transnational business communication by helping
   professionals to understand the language and cultural challenges faced
   by Chinese business expatriates, and offers suggestions for globalizing
   companies that send employees to host countries.},

Abstract = {Background: Virtual teams are more and more common since the internet
   and mobile revolutions. Organizations are facing new challenges due to
   the lack of interpersonal relationships between the members of these
   teams. This study examines common team processes in an e-environment,
   relying upon two virtual team types: temporary and ongoing teams.
   Literature review: The aim of the review is to provide an overview of
   the challenges of such teams and to understand the complexity of team
   processes in such an environment. Research questions: 1. Does the type
   of virtual team have an impact on the quality of common team processes?
   2. Can criteria be identified to determine which type of virtual team is
   more appropriate for given tasks? Research methodology: A quantitative
   test was conducted to compare the mean gaps between temporary and
   ongoing teams in trust, communication, and five collaborative processes.
   Then, by employing qualitative thematic analysis, we constructed a
   conceptual model to understand the reasons for these mean gaps. Results:
   Primary findings indicate that all but one of the tested processes
   achieved higher levels in ongoing teams rather than in temporary ones.
   Also, the more the collaborative process entails complex activities
   involving social bonds, the greater the gaps between the two team types.
   Conclusion: At the initiation of a virtual team, it would be best to
   focus on projects limited to elementary activities. If more complex team
   activities are anticipated, virtual team members should work together
   for an extended period.},

Abstract = {Background: This paper examines creativity in content management (CM) by
   presenting a case study analysis of an original, open-source, web-based
   learning-management system (LMS). It explores existing literature and
   suggests new ideas about creativity and CM. Research questions: How can
   we conceptualize creativity in relation to CM? How can creativity be
   operationalized into specific design practices within CM? What
   dimensions of creativity should be considered when designing or
   evaluating creative CM systems? Situating the case: Theoretical research
   in content-management systems (CMSs) and LMSs has revealed a gap in our
   field's current understanding of how creativity relates to CM. Research
   studies related to the measurement of creativity have provided insight
   into characteristics and methodologies that could be adopted and adapted
   to evaluate creativity in CM. Studies from the learning sciences have
   investigated where LMSs fall short and suggested where new opportunities
   exist to better facilitate the informational needs of users. These works
   have pointed to a need for research on integrating creativity and CM,
   both in content and in the systems that manage content, and have laid
   the groundwork for this study. Methodology: This research investigates
   theories of creativity as they relate to CM by conducting a case study
   analysis of unique instructional software designed to deliver content to
   students enrolled in a university course. The primary evidence is taken
   from notes about the design and evaluation of the software and from
   survey data illustrating students' user experiences. About the case: We
   developed a classification strategy for exploring creativity along three
   dimensions-importance, novelty, and affect-and then used this strategy
   to explore a unique system's approach to deal with content challenges in
   each of those areas. User experience impressions provide evidence of
   successes and failures of experimental CM in these domains. Conclusions:
   The study finds that this original LMS design did contain features that
   exhibited novelty, importance, and affect, and that such features can be
   used to identify creativity in product design as well as to assess the
   design of complex software systems such as CMSs and LMSs. This detailed
   analysis of an original design for an LMS suggests new ideas for
   implementing and using CMSs and LMSs in technical communication. The
   study concludes by presenting a rubric for evaluating creativity in CMSs
   and LMSs, or for designing such systems with creativity in mind.},

Title = {Public Engagement in Environmental Impact Studies: A Case Study of
   Professional Communication in Transportation Planning},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {245-260},

Abstract = {Background: Environmental impact studies often enlist professional
   communicators to develop and implement public engagement plans and
   processes. However, few detailed reports of these public engagement
   plans exist in either scholarly venues or government reports. This case
   reviews one public engagement project in transportation planning as
   implemented by one professional communications firm. Research questions:
   1) What communication and engagement strategies do the consultants
   employ in their public engagement process? 2) How do professional
   communicators design engagement for diverse citizen groups? Situating
   the case: A number of cases have revealed the ways professional and
   technical communicators integrate participatory or user-centered design
   strategies in public engagement projects. These cases suggest that
   professional and technical communicators are uniquely positioned to
   develop ethical and effective public engagement plans for environmental
   impact studies. Professional and technical communicators are further
   prepared for this work because of their knowledge about theories of
   intercultural communication and rhetorical theories of delivery.
   Methodology: This case was studied over the course of 1.5 years using
   qualitative research methods, including observations, interviews, and
   textual analysis. About the case: This case reviews the work of one
   particular public engagement firm, VTC Communications, as they planned
   and implemented public engagement in one environmental impact study.
   This environmental impact study team was tasked with determining the
   best way to accommodate the increase in rail traffic the city
   anticipated with the development of the high-speed rail. The public's
   input was needed to fulfill environmental impact statement (EIS)
   requirements and to fully understand the community concerns regarding
   the increased traffic, noise, vibrations, and family/business
   displacements. VTC Communications was hired to conduct this portion of
   the environmental impact study, and their work included the development
   of a range of deliverables and events. Conclusions: This case provides
   an overview of the process of developing public engagement plans, the
   deliverables designed, as well as the key goals that guided the
   development of public engagement. My case suggests that effective public
   engagement can address intercultural concerns by developing projects
   that are adaptable, multimodal, and dialogic.},

Abstract = {Research problem: In recent years, many businesses have become involved
   in internationalized projects, yet understanding the dynamics of
   engineering communication in virtual dispersed teams is limited.
   Research questions: How do the factors mentioned in the literature
   function in an international engineering project? Are there factors that
   enhance or constrain the work in an engineering setting that are not
   mentioned in previous studies? Literature review: Existing knowledge on
   the contextual factors that affect virtual international professional
   communication is mainly built on the study of the communication
   practices of students or business professionals who are not engineers.
   Results of that literature have identified factors that enhance
   communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include cross-cultural
   training, using appropriate communication technology, face-to-face
   communication opportunities, respect for partners, regularly scheduled
   meetings, a common language, a common discipline, and cross-cultural
   understandings though popular media). There are factors that challenge
   communication for dispersed virtual teams (which include differing
   cultural assumptions, differing cultural communication styles, US
   Government export control regulations, proximity and time issues, and
   differing levels of perceived power and influence). Methodology: This
   study involved observing international engineer meetings in the US and
   the UK and interviewing 19 engineers leading an international design
   team. The participants worked for the same international company with
   about half from the US and half in Great Britain. Results and
   discussion: Many of the factors identified in general professional
   communication studies held true for this context. But some features were
   unique to an engineering environment that the literature had not
   previously mentioned, including iplanning for and working with
   intercultural dispersed virtual engineering teams and that people need
   to consider many complexities of culture that affect communication
   practices. Because this study observed one team in the context of only
   two cultures, future research may determine whether these factors are
   more widely found in other teams, workplaces, and cultures. Future
   research may also determine the relative levels of influence of the
   contextual factors on international dispersed virtual engineering teams.
   In addition, the study of engineers learning to communicate in
   international settings may be illuminating.},

Abstract = {Problem: Technical writers rarely work on patent applications, but the
   typical documents writers prepare during research and development are
   important during patent disputes. Patent disputes are so costly that the
   potential for these disputes weighs heavily on the minds of those
   preparing patent applications. The relationship between technical
   documentation and the legal processes surrounding research and
   development need to shape a writer's documentation practice. Research
   question: What legal concepts do technical writers need to know when
   working in research and development? Key concepts: Patent prosecution is
   the process of obtaining a patent. Technology transfer is the
   communication that places an innovation into the marketplace. Patent
   disputes arise when a party believes its patent rights have been
   infringed. The work of technical writers becomes relevant during patent
   disputes. Two Supreme Court cases inform the process for reconstructing
   the meaning of patent claims during a dispute: and limits the audience
   who determines the meaning of a claim to the judge instead of a jury,
   and Phillips establishes the role written documents have in a patent
   dispute. The case shows how a judge might use technical documentation to
   determine the meaning of a patent claim or term. From these cases, we
   can draw strategies for preparing technical documents. Key lessons:
   While impossible to know prior to a patent dispute how a document will
   affect the outcome of the dispute, technical communicators can adopt
   three strategies for preparing precise and complete documents. First,
   technical writers can adopt a ``liminal{''} practice-the ability to
   interact as needed with different disciplines. Second, technical
   communicators can approach new subjects with assent, a type of seeking
   understood in order to fully explore a new technology. And third,
   technical communicators can approach writing about research and
   development as a technical translation practice to translate highly
   scientific or technical language into precise plain language.
   Implications to practice: By developing a liminal practice, technical
   communicators can build a robust documentation practice that includes
   the contextual nuances essential for work in patent prosecution and
   technology transfer.},

Title = {Too Early, Too Bad: Uncovering and Understanding the Initial
   Participation Paradox in Technology-Mediated Learning Teams},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {Research Problem: Time is of the essence in technology-mediated teams.
   However, research has been inconclusive about the impact of team
   participation on outcomes. A possible reason can be found in the
   temporal dimension; particularly, we refer to the time points examined
   in relation to the entirety of the period. Indeed, we can find research
   attention on initial participation (IP) in fields such as social
   psychology. IP refers to the contributions of team members during the
   earlier half of the team's lifespan. Comparable efforts are in want in
   information systems contexts where the relevancy and saliency of IP is
   no less. Research Questions: Does IP affect outcomes of
   technology-mediated teams? Do team size and task type affect IP in
   technology-mediated teams? Literature Review: Based on a review of
   literature that includes group development, information overload, and
   integrative complexity, we discover an IP paradox. More intense IP, in
   terms of amount and equality, could decrease outcomes, namely, task
   performance, team learning, and outcome satisfaction. Moreover, two
   cornerstone boundary conditions of teamwork, team size and task type,
   could affect IP. Methodology: A quantitative field experiment with 49
   technology-mediated learning teams that involved 245 participants was
   conducted. These teams used a wiki to complete a task in a course in
   higher education. Data were collected from a pretest survey, posttest
   survey, and electronic records of the wiki (editcount and wordcount).
   Qualitative data from participants were also sought for the sake of
   triangulation. The data were analyzed using partial least squares.
   Results and Discussion: The results show that higher IP amount and
   equality decreased task performance and outcome satisfaction as
   predicted. However, higher IP amount did not significantly affect team
   learning although this was significant in the hypothesized direction for
   IP equality. As for team size, larger team sizes increased IP amount but
   lowered IP equality. Task type did not affect IP amount and contrary to
   our prediction, multiple solution tasks instead of single solution tasks
   decreased IP equality. Nevertheless, the findings support the notion
   that higher IP leads to detrimental outcomes. This suggests the
   importance of coordination mechanisms in the initial period especially
   in time-limited teams. For instance, knowledge leaders and facilitators
   can step up to organize and reduce information overload during the
   initial period to ensure an easier time synthesizing in the later period
   and better task performance. The current work was limited in terms of
   using only objective data for participation amount and equality. Future
   research could involve a combination of perceptual and objective data as
   well as other types of participation constructs, such as task related,
   norms and rules, and socioemotional acts for a richer insight into the
   IP paradox.},

Abstract = {Research Problem: Investigate the match between content published by the
   TRANSACTIONS and content sought by its readers. Research Questions: What
   content does the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION
   publish? How does that compare to the content published by other
   journals in the field? And what content do readers of the TRANSACTIONS
   want to read? Literature Review: Researchers in most fields occasionally
   analyze the entire body of literature within a discipline to assess the
   current state of the literature, identify leading works, assess the
   state of the literature, provide a basis for changing the direction of a
   journal, and assess alignment among parts of the literature.
   Methodology: To identify what journals published, researchers used the
   STC Body of Knowledge schema and a list of categories of research
   methods that classify all peer-reviewed articles published between
   January 2006 and December 2010 in the TRANSACTIONS, Journal of Business
   and Technical Communication, Technical Communication, and Technical
   Communication Quarterly. To identify reader preferences of the
   TRANSACTIONS, researchers surveyed members of the IEEE Professional
   Communication Society about their preferences for content and types of
   research. Results and Discussion: In terms of the topics covered, the
   three most widely covered topics in the TRANSACTIONS were: (1)
   Deliverables, (2) Information Design and Development, and (3) Academic
   Programs. Readers prefer (1) About Technical and Professional
   Communication, (2) Information Design and Development, and (3) Research
   Theory, and Practice. The three least-covered topics were (1) Business
   Knowledge, (2) About Technical Communication, and (3) Technical
   Communication Standards. Of least interest to participants were: (1)
   Deliverables, (2) Quality Assurance, (3) Management, and (4) Technical
   Communication Standards. The TRANSACTIONS primarily publishes
   experiments, surveys, and tutorials while readers prefer case studies,
   literature reviews, and tutorials.},

Title = {Media richness or media naturalness? The evolution of our biological
   communication apparatus and its influence on our behavior toward
   e-communication tools},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {48},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {E-communication in businesses has been the target of intense research.
   The media richness hypothesis has been influential in some
   e-communication research circles and has also been strongly attacked by
   social theorists. It is argued in this paper that this theoretical
   polarization involving advocates of the media richness hypothesis and
   social theorists is due to two problems. The first is that there is a
   wealth of empirical evidence that provides direct support for the notion
   that human beings prefer the face-to-face medium for a variety of
   business tasks that involve communication, which seems to provide
   support for the media richness hypothesis. The second problem is that
   the media richness hypothesis is built on a vacuum, as no underlying
   explanation was ever presented by media richness theorists for our
   predisposition toward rich (or face-to-face) media. The main goal of
   this paper is to offer a solution to these problems by providing an
   alternative to the media richness hypothesis, referred to here as media
   naturalness hypothesis, developed based on Darwin's theory of evolution.
   The media naturalness hypothesis argues that, other things being equal,
   a decrease in the degree of naturalness of a communication medium (or
   its degree of similarity to the face-to-face medium) leads to the
   following effects in connection with a communication interaction: (1)
   increased cognitive effort, (2) increased communication ambiguity, and
   (3) decreased physiological arousal. Like the media richness hypothesis,
   the media naturalness hypothesis has important implications for the
   selection, use; and deployment of e-communication tools in
   organizations. However unlike the media richness hypothesis, the media
   naturalness hypothesis is compatible with social theories of behavior
   toward e-communication tools. Among other things, this paper shows that
   the media naturalness hypothesis (unlike its media richness counterpart)
   is compatible with the notion that, regardless of the obstacles posed by
   low naturalness media, individuals using those media to perform
   collaborative tasks may achieve the same or better task-related outcomes
   than individuals using media with higher degrees of naturalness.},

Abstract = {With the globalization of the world economy, it is imperative that
   managers, both present and future, be sensitive to differences in
   intercultural business communication. In particular, the context of
   global electronic commerce leads to an increasing use of email in
   negotiating deals, which to this point has been carried out almost
   exclusively via face-to-face (FTF) or other high-feedback media (e.g.,
   telephone) but not of non-FTF media, This study, involving 20

Title = {Discursive Construction of Message Credibility for Chinese State-Owned
   Enterprises on Twitter},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 18},
Abstract = {Background: There is a growing need for Chinese state-owned enterprises
   (CSOEs) to utilize Twitter, as an effective communicative tool in the
   professional business context, to build a credible image to the global
   community. Literature review: Little attention has been paid to
   measuring the discursive construction of message credibility through
   corporate Twitter. Therefore, based on the theoretical insights of
   message credibility from existing literature on communication and
   information science, our study has conceptually developed a broad
   framework to measure the message credibility of CSOEs' Twitter discourse
   from two general aspects (content and form), four separate levels
   (\{thematic\}, \{intrinsic\}, \{contextual\}, and \{representational\}),
   and nine specific dimensions (, , , , , , , , and ). With the help of
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) and corpus tools (MAT, CLA, TAALES,
   GAMET, SeANCE, and TAACO), the framework has been practically
   operationalized by a total of 62 discursive features, including 18
   content-based themes (thematic features) and 44 form-based features.
   Research questions: 1. What themes do CSOEs develop, and how do they
   express these themes to establish message credibility in their tweets?
   2. Which dimensions of message credibility are significantly highlighted
   in CSOEs' tweets? 3. Which enterprises establish the highest message
   credibility in their tweets? Methodology: We collected tweets during the
   year 2020 from the official Twitter accounts of 15 CSOEs and applied our
   operationalized framework to conduct nine separate One-way ANOVAs, a
   principal component analysis (PCA), and a mean-value based descriptive
   statistics comparison, respectively. Results: First, CSOEs developed
   themes including strength, power, cooperation, and legitimacy, among
   others, and used discursive features including nominalizations,
   mentions/@ , word length, time adverbials, hashtags/\#, and semantic
   overlaps, among others when expressing these themes to establish message
   credibility. Second, CSOEs significantly highlighted the , , , and
   dimensions of message credibility in their tweets. Last, China National
   Machinery Industry Co. (Sinomach), China Datang Co. (CDC), China Railway
   Engineering Co. (CREC), and China State Construction Engineering Co.
   (CSCEC) were found to have established the highest message credibility
   in their tweets. Discussion and conclusion: Our study may be the first
   to generate an NLP-cum-corpus-operationalized framework to
   quantitatively measure the discursive realization of message credibility
   in the context of business communication on social media. It also
   provides some practical insights into how relevant business professions
   can utilize certain discursive resources to establish message
   credibility in the B2C communication on social media.},

Abstract = {Background: There is a lack of conceptual framework for how to develop
   more inclusive practices in the subfield of technical editing.
   Literature review: Some researchers have posited theories, like feminism
   and rhetorical theory, as ways to conceptualize technical editing. This
   piece extends that literature into social justice using Walton, Moore,
   and Jones's 3Ps heuristic of positionality, privilege, and power.
   Research questions: 1. What ideologies are circulating in technical
   editing pedagogy? 2. How might technical editing pedagogy become more
   inclusive? Methodology: We conduct a rhetorical analysis of the major
   academic works in technical editing, including books, textbooks, and
   academic articles, and compare them to an established framework for
   social justice in technical and professional communication-the 3Ps
   heuristic. Results: We find that there are strong instrumentalist
   underpinnings to much of the current literature in technical editing,
   making the goal of technical editing linguistic conformity to American
   Standard English (ASE) at the expense of linguistic diversity. We offer
   a conceptual framework, the inclusive editing paradigm (IEP), to
   challenge that linguistic hegemony in technical editing and provide
   technical editors with theoretical and practical foundations for
   developing a more inclusive editing practice. Conclusions: More work
   needs to be done to shift technical editing in a more inclusive
   direction. We call on practitioners, academics, and users to contribute
   to this dialogue.},

Abstract = {Background: Engineers increasingly work and advance their careers in
   international business settings. As technical managers, they need
   management and technical skills when working with different stakeholders
   with whom they may not share a common first language. Studies have
   revealed that informal oral communication skills are of prime importance
   for global engineers who face challenges in building shared meaning and
   formulating clear messages in meetings with non-native speakers of
   English. This article proposes that studying the use of multimodal
   resources (spoken language, gaze, gestures, and objects) in meetings can
   unpack how work tasks are accomplished in business through different
   communicative strategies. Literature review: This paper focuses on
   engineers' and technical managers' needs and challenges in professional
   and intercultural communication where English is used as a business
   lingua franca (BELF) in multimodal meetings. While multimodal
   conversation and discourse analytic studies highlight the dynamic nature
   of meeting interaction, previous technical and professional
   communication and BELF research on multimodality is limited. Research
   questions: 1. How do technical managers use multimodal resources to
   articulate their ideas in BELF meetings with their peers? 2. How does
   the use of multimodal resources contribute to the construction of shared
   meaning in explanatory, consensus-seeking, and solution-finding
   communication? Methodology: This study reports on two case studies and
   multimodal discourse analysis of video-recorded meetings among technical
   managers and their peers in four companies. The use of multimodal
   resources is analyzed in explanatory, consensus-seeking, and
   solution-finding communication. Results and conclusions: In BELF
   meetings, assemblages of spoken language, gestures, tools, whiteboard,
   and documents contribute to constructing shared meaning. This study has
   implications for global professional and engineering communication.
   Future research should further examine multimodality in BELF meetings.},

Title = {Scrum Language Use in a Software Engineering Firm: An Exploratory Study},

Abstract = {Background: Although agile and Scrum have been important frameworks in
   software engineering for over a decade, little research has explored how
   teams use Scrum language within their sprints. Literature review: Most
   explorations of Scrum communication have been collected through
   self-reported means. These studies are inherently unable to explore how
   Scrum teams use Scrum-centric language in their meetings in ways that
   adhere or run counter to standard Scrum practice. Research questions: 1.
   In what ways is Scrum reflected in the language used by team members in
   various sprint meetings? 2. What associations exist between the job
   title of team members and their use of Scrum language? 3. What does a
   discourse analysis reveal about the ways in which this team uses
   language to value and discount Scrum? Research methodology: For three
   sprints over 10 weeks, I recorded meetings of 27 Scrum team members. I
   transcribed these meetings, developed a codebook for assigning Scrum
   language categories, conducted an interrater reliability agreement on
   the data, completed a correspondence analysis on how Scrum language
   associates with meeting types and job titles, and conducted a discourse
   analysis to determine in what ways these teams value and discount Scrum.
   Results/discussion: Scrum language was found in all recorded meetings
   across all three sprints, with much language found in the planning
   meetings. Few associations existed between Scrum language and job title,
   suggesting that Scrum at this engineering firm is an egalitarian
   process. In addition, the discourse analysis revealed that this
   engineering firm valued User Story and Sprint Execution language while
   discounting Capacity and Story Pointing language. Conclusions: Although
   this group broadly adheres to Scrum practices about 68\% of the time,
   this study finds that several current standard components of Scrum are
   routinely discounted. This exploratory study suggests that more research
   into the in-situ use of Scrum language in engineering workplaces is
   necessary to better inform engineering professionals about the
   communicative expectations of Scrum and to better enable engineering
   communication educators to prepare future engineers for Scrum realities.},

Title = {Diagrams in Contracts: Fostering Understanding in Global Business
   Communication},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {Research problem: Business-to-business contracts are complex
   communication artifacts, often considered ``legal stuff{''} and the
   exclusive domain of lawyers. However, many other stakeholders without a
   legal background are involved in the negotiation, drafting, approval,
   and implementation of contracts, and their contributions are essential
   for successful business relationships. How can we ensure that all
   stakeholders in the global business context-whatever their native
   language or professional background-easily and accurately understand
   contract documents? This study suggests that integrating diagrams in
   contracts can result in faster and more accurate comprehension, for both
   native and non-native speakers of English. Literature review: We focused
   on the following research topics: (1) ways to integrate text and visuals
   to create more effective instructions, since we conceptualize contracts
   as a type of business instructions; (2) cognitive load theory, as it may
   help explain why contracts are so hard to understand and why
   text-visuals integration may ameliorate their understandability; (3)
   cognitive styles, as individual differences may affect how individuals
   process verbal and visual information, thus allowing us to explore the
   limitations of our suggested approach; (4) the English lingua franca
   spoken by business professionals in international settings, their needs
   and challenges, and the fact that pragmatic approaches are needed to
   ensure successful communication. Methodology: We conducted an experiment
   with 122 contract experts from 24 countries. The research participants
   were asked to complete a series of comprehension tasks regarding a
   contract, which was provided in either a traditional, text-only version
   or in a version that included diagrams as complements to the text. In
   addition to measuring answering speed and accuracy, we asked the
   participants to provide information about their educational background,
   mother tongue, and perceived mental effort in task completion, and to
   complete an object-spatial imagery and verbal questionnaire to assess
   their cognitive style. Conclusions: We found that integrating diagrams
   into contracts supports faster and more accurate comprehension;
   unexpectedly, legal background and different cognitive styles do not
   interact with this main effect. We also discovered that both native and
   non-native speakers of English benefit from the presence of diagrams in
   terms of accuracy, but that this effect is particularly strong for
   non-native speakers. The implication of this study is that adding
   diagrams to contracts can help global communicators to understand such
   documents more quickly and accurately. The need for well-designed
   contracts may open new opportunities for professional writers and
   information designers. Future research may also go beyond experimental
   evaluations: by observing this new genre of contracts in vivo, it would
   be possible to shed light on how contract visualizations would be
   perceived and interpreted in a global communication environment.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of
   the cultural intelligence of a dyad (a team of two persons) on its
   global virtual collaboration processes and outcomes. Research question:
   Does a dyad's cultural intelligence have an effect on global virtual
   collaboration processes and outcomes? If yes, which effects does that
   cultural intelligence have? Literature review: We review literature on
   the management of cultural diversity in global virtual collaboration and
   cultural intelligence. The literature suggests that cultural diversity
   in global virtual teams is mainly managed with rigid approaches, which
   are ineffective in many situations. Leveraging cultural intelligence has
   the potential to improve global virtual collaboration. However, its
   effects at the team level or in a virtual setting are not yet clear.
   Methodology: We used a collaboration simulation with 70 participants
   recruited from two public universities in China and Germany to study the
   effects of cultural intelligence. Quantitative and qualitative data were
   collected through questionnaires, voice recorders, and computer logs.
   Bale's interaction process analysis was used to code the voice
   recordings, and ordinary least-squares regression was used to test the
   hypotheses. Results and conclusions: The results indicate that cultural
   intelligence has an effect on global virtual collaboration; the lower
   cultural intelligence and the higher cultural intelligence in a dyad
   exert different effects on global virtual collaboration. Specifically,
   the lower cultural intelligence significantly influences the frequency
   of collaborative behaviors, which further influence group satisfaction.
   In contrast, the higher cultural intelligence significantly influences
   the deliverable quality. The findings advance the understanding of the
   effects of cultural intelligence at a dyad level and on proximal
   behavioral outcomes. The study has practical implications for global
   virtual collaboration practitioners and collaborative virtual
   environment designers. The study is limited by using student subjects
   and a self-report measure of cultural intelligence, as well as by
   examining global virtual teams in their simplest form. Future studies
   are suggested to examine contingency factors on the relationships
   between cultural intelligence and global virtual collaboration processes
   and outcomes.},

   alternative to the way entrepreneurs traditionally raise start-up and
   operational funds for a venture. Moreover, with crowdfunding platforms,
   citizens and communities are increasingly able to engage in
   entrepreneurial work not only for profit but also to address social and
   civic problems. Problem: Given the expanding boundaries of
   entrepreneurship, it is increasingly important for professional and
   technical communication teachers to prepare students to be ethical
   entrepreneurs and embody a widening array of rhetorical skills. Our
   teaching case addresses the question of how we might incorporate new and
   emerging forms of entrepreneurship, such as crowdfunding, into the
   professional and technical communication classroom in ways that
   foreground the social, civic, and ethical dimensions of that work.
   Situating the case: To address this question, we first situate our
   teaching case in relevant literature from professional and technical
   communication and social entrepreneurship, and then compare it with
   similar cases of crowdfunding being used for educational purposes. How
   the case was studied: We describe what we observed before, during, and
   after teaching a project structured thematically around civic
   crowdfunding. We had two sources of data: (1) a collection of teaching
   materials, including syllabi, day-to-day lesson plans, project prompts,
   in-class activities, correspondence between instructors, and informal
   teaching logs used to record impromptu reflections throughout the course
   of the semester; and (2) the civic crowdfunding project materials
   produced by students. About the case: Two distinct but related problems
   have motivated the development of this teaching case: (1) the context of
   21st-century entrepreneurship has rapidly changed as a result of new
   approaches, including crowdfunding; (2) this shift has also led to an
   increased emphasis on civic and social matters of concern, which have
   increasingly become more important in contemporary business models.
   Ultimately, we seek to understand how entrepreneurial writing projects
   can meld commercial and financial motivations with civic exigencies,
   direct participation, and stakeholder engagement. As such, this civic
   crowdfunding sequence takes place over two phases: (1) students
   conducted primary and secondary research on a local problem or exigency
   and used this as evidence for a white paper and a project proposal; (2)
   students developed a feasible solution to this problem which then formed
   the basis for crowdfunding campaign materials, including a Kickstarter
   page, campaign video, and branding materials. Results: Our results focus
   on two projects that clearly foreground a social and civic mission; we
   point to these two projects not as perfect examples, but rather as
   illustrative cases of how students engaged crowdfunding as a form of
   civic entrepreneurship. Conclusions: Our teaching case has demonstrated
   the need to prepare students not only to pitch venture ideas for a small
   audience of investors, but also to consider how to identify and frame
   problems, construct stories about these problems as pressing matters of
   concern and, ultimately, develop ethical relationships with stakeholders
   and increasingly diverse investors.},

Abstract = {Problem: Standards provide a substantive, internationally supported
   framework through which information can be managed, developed, reviewed,
   tested, maintained in a content-management system, and published in a
   variety of forms. Research question: Why are standards and standards
   development important for information development and management? Key
   concepts: (1) The International Organization for Standardization defines
   a standard as ``a document that provides requirements, specifications,
   guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure
   that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their
   purpose.{''} (2) Several types of standards exist, such as unit
   standards (which describe measures), private standards reached by
   consensus and that most participants in an industry agree to, and
   public, de jure, or legally mandated standards. Standards exist for
   authoring and publishing tools. (3) Using a standard managed and
   controlled by a standards organization means gaining the insights of
   experienced individuals working through an internationally recognized
   body. 4) Standards are developed by consensus under the auspices of a
   major organization, such as IEEE, ISO, or OASIS. (5) Major standards
   affecting information development include technical standards for
   authoring and publishing, including portable document format, eXtensible
   markup language, Hypertext Markup Language, and content standards, such
   as Darwin information typing architecture (DITA), DocBook, and S1000D.
   Key lessons: (1) Use standards to manage content development. (2) Use
   standards to acquire services to support the development of content. (3)
   Use standards to review and test information. (4) Use standards to
   manage agile information development. (5) Use standards to manage the
   development of documentation through the software-development life
   cycle. (6) Use standards to select and implement a content-management
   system. (7) Hire information developers who understand the importance of
   using standards. Implications to practice: Standards provide a means for
   information developers to ensure that they are managing and developing
   content effectively. Implementing standards in an organization helps to
   ensure that technology choices made today will not restrict future
   technology developments.},

Abstract = {Research problem: In partially distributed teams, where some members are
   co-located while others are geographically distant, co-located members
   tend to treat one another as a preferential `{''}Us{''} versus treating
   distant members as the outsiders, `{''}Them.{''} Research questions: (1)
   To what extent is Us-vs.-Them reported as a problem across a wide number
   of organizational partially distributed teams, and is it significantly
   related to team effectiveness? (2) What do members see as the greatest
   challenges to partially distributed teams? and (3) Can partially
   distributed teams overcome in-group dynamics? If so, how? Literature
   review: In our literature review, we begin by discussing in-group
   dynamics to set the theoretical framework for our research. We call
   these dynamics us versus them (Us-vs.-Them) and show, through empirical
   studies and organizational studies, what makes partially distributed
   teams especially susceptible to such dynamics. The major susceptibility
   factors we find are: limited synchronous availability, conflicting goals
   and responsibilities, and uneven communication channels. We then review
   literature that exemplifies conflict in such teams (even if it is not
   the focus of the study). We attempt to relate the resulting conflict or
   problem reported to the susceptibility factors identified. Methodology:
   We use qualitative and quantitative analysis from a survey of 238
   professionals, recruited through snowball sampling, reporting on their
   experiences in partially distributed teams. Snowball sampling limits
   generalizability of the findings. Results and conclusions: We find that
   Us-vs.-Them can be traced back to the susceptibility factors that exist
   in partially distributed teams, particularly an imbalance in
   communication channels between versus within subgroups. A strong
   negative correlation between Us-vs.-Them and effectiveness indicates the
   importance of future research on Us-vs.-Them reduction. A key finding is
   that some survey respondents report effective outcomes despite
   Us-vs.-Them; these responders also report different concerns than those
   who view their teams as ineffective.},

Abstract = {Using a within-subjects field experiment, we tested the differences
   between paper-based and electronic employee surveys. Employees of a
   large organization were invited to respond to a paper survey as well as
   an identical electronic survey. Results from 134 employees who completed
   both questionnaires indicated that electronic surveys were seen as
   marginally easier to use and more enjoyable than paper surveys. However,
   the paper-based questionnaires produced a higher response rate. The
   self-reported likelihood that participants would respond to similar
   questionnaires in the future did not differ between the two formats.
   After comparing the answers on survey items that measured feelings of
   well-being and spending patterns, data quality also appeared to be
   equivalent across the two formats. Conceptual issues, as well as the
   implications for managers who are administering employee surveys, are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {When the primary aim of global, professional communication expands to
   include rapport building in addition to information sharing, basic parts
   of the communication process must be reevaluated. Such an assessment was
   conducted through a case study of a team that adapted a US training
   seminar for a Japanese audience. The team's strong emphasis on the
   communicative aim of relationship building illustrated how traditional
   conceptions of rhetorical invention, packaging, delivery, and feedback
   collection might be revised. For practitioners and educators, the
   findings of this case study prompt a reevaluation of the rhetorical
   abilities that are required in global professional communication
   contexts.},

Abstract = {When developers need to make a system available for a particular
   culture, the specific aspects of the target group are evaluated and then
   the content and navigation are ``localized{''} for it. However, there
   are many situations in which web media cannot be localized and hence,
   culturally heterogeneous users must interact with the same interface.
   The emerging strategy for this kind of usability is known as the shared
   meaning or shared context approach. This paper presents results of a
   between-group study of culturally heterogeneous users who provided
   shared contextual meanings and performance measures from interaction
   with a web interface. Results were mixed but do suggest methods for how
   websites may be developed in shared situations.},

Abstract = {New forms of computer-mediated, online learning can benefit from new
   forms of assessment that fit the medium and the pedagogical style of the
   online environment. This paper investigates students' learning styles
   and learning strategies in taking online collaborative exams. Applying
   constructivist and collaborative learning theories, the collaborative
   examination features students' active participation in various phases of
   the exam process through small group activities online. Students'
   learning strategies, including deep learning and collaborative learning,
   are investigated using a 1 x 3 field quasi-experiment to compare the
   team-based collaborative online exam with the traditional in-class exam
   and with the participatory exam, where students participate in the
   online exam processes individually. Data analysis using results from 485
   students indicates that collaborative examinations significantly reduced
   surface learning in exam study, enhanced interactions and the sense of
   an online learning community, and increased perceived learning. The
   results also suggest learning predispositions were significantly
   correlated with exam study strategies, and provide indications of their
   effects on learning strategies.},

Abstract = {This paper examines two components of the user-database interface: the
   data modeling constructs used to represent the database structure
   and,the query language constructs used for data retrieval. From a
   theoretical perspective, if, both the data modeling and query language
   support high-level abstractions (HLAs), such as generalization and
   composition, then the ``semantic distance{''} between the user and the
   interface will be reduced. We. used an in-depth verbal protocol study to
   explore how users were able to effectively complete two tasks:
   constructing a data model with HLAS and formulating queries against the
   data model. Results suggest that a successful strategy for modeling with
   HLAs involves the systematic transition between higher and lower levels
   of abstraction. In addition, there is some support for the idea that
   there is a ``productivity payoff' to modeling with HLAs, because
   subsequent query can be simplified.},

Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the effects that team size has on
   geographically distributed team behavior and technology choice. We
   report results from a survey of distributed team members conducted
   within a large, multinational technology manufacturing organization.
   Survey responses indicate that compared to members of larger teams,
   members of smaller teams participated more actively on their team, were
   more committed to their team, were more aware of the goals of the team,
   had greater awareness of other team members, and were in teams with
   higher levels of rapport. Larger teams are more conscientious than
   smaller teams in preparing meeting agendas. Team size was also
   associated with different technology choice: larger teams adopted
   technology to support the coordination of asynchronous work, while
   smaller teams adopted technology that primarily supported collaboration.
   We discuss the implications of distributed team size for team
   performance and technology adoption.},

Abstract = {Professionals involved in the creation of text-based communication face
   a number of challenges. These include overburdened and often
   uninterested users juxtaposed with the writer's desire to communicate
   relevant topical information. Uninvolved users are likely to ignore the
   message. This may be exacerbated by increases in text length designed to
   increase the amount and/or detail of information to be communicated. An
   experiment was conducted to examine the effect of rhetorical figures in
   text headings as to how users read and process the text (hereafter,
   readership, as used in marketing). To the extent that higher levels of
   text readership increase user knowledge and skills, enhance
   topic-related attitudes, and facilitate beneficial topic-related
   behaviors, higher readership should yield desirable communication
   outcomes. Headings with rhetorical figures were hypothesized to enhance
   readership, particularly under conditions generally associated with
   relatively low readership, namely, lower perceived information relevance
   and longer text. Results generally support rhetorical figures' abilities
   to enhance readership, especially with longer texts.},

Title = {Understanding the Effects of Visual Cueing on Social Media Engagement
   With YouTube Educational Videos},

Abstract = {Background: Social media like YouTube have transformative effects on
   technical communication. Technical communication scholars have attended
   to the increasing use of social media personally, pedagogically, and
   professionally. Our stream of research focuses on YouTube videos for
   educational purposes within the various research avenues. Literature
   review: YouTube has become a viable platform for learning. YouTube
   educational videos have been studied from many different perspectives,
   yet research on engagement with YouTube educational videos is scarce,
   despite the importance of engagement in both learning and social media.
   Following extant research on YouTube educational video features, we
   probe the effects of visual cueing on social media engagement. Research
   question: How does visual cueing (anchors and intrinsic visual features)
   affect social media engagement with YouTube educational videos?
   Methodology: We sampled 196 YouTube educational videos on 28 physics and
   astronomy topics, and extracted visual cueing from the videos and social
   media engagement information from YouTube. Multiple linear regression
   analyses were conducted. Results: Our analyses show that intrinsic
   visual features (color contrast and visual complexity) are significantly
   related to social media engagement (involvement, intimacy, and
   interaction), while anchors (math equations and models) are not.
   Conclusion: Our study supports the empirical knowledge on social media
   engagement with YouTube educational videos and expands on the technical
   communication research for YouTube educational videos. In addition, this
   research contributes to the literature on engagement by extending its
   relevance to the social media learning environment. Finally, our study
   provides content creators with new video design insights that can be
   used to enhance social media engagement with YouTube educational videos.},

Title = {Prioritizing Access as a Social Justice Concern: Advocating for Ableism
   Studies and Disability Justice in Technical and Professional
   Communication},

Abstract = {Introduction: This experiential teaching case study calls for technical
   and professional communicators to apply a combination of ableism studies
   and disability justice in examining their participation in potentially
   ableist, normative systems. Situating the case: Previous technical and
   professional communication (TPC) scholarship has demonstrated how the
   field of disability studies (DS) furthers TPC's goals of social justice,
   but it has not offered methods to trace the systemic ableist assumptions
   that contribute to disability's marginalization. I thus extend these
   considerations through attention to disability justice and ableism
   studies. About the case: This teaching case evaluates my attempt to
   incorporate DS into my Writing for the Professions class by examining
   the warrants or assumptions reflected in class materials and student
   discussions to determine how DS's inclusion in the course impacted such
   warrants. Methods/approach: I used thematic coding to analyze class
   documents, student work, and semistructured student interviews and
   traced how reflected warrants contributed to understandings of ability
   and disability. Results/discussion: I found that analyzed documents
   predominantly relied on ableist warrants that obscured disability's
   relationality, positioned disability as deviance, limited efforts
   towards social change, and disregarded disability's intersectional
   complexity. Conclusion: To counter the use of ableist warrants that
   impede social justice goals, I recommend that TPC instructors foster
   critical understandings of systemic ableism by applying disability
   justice principles to their course materials. Through a combination of
   ableism studies and disability justice, TPC can pursue more socially
   just documentation practices.},

Title = {A Comparison of Research Topics Associated With Technical Communication,
   Business Communication, and Professional Communication, 1963-2017},

Abstract = {Background: Technical communication, business communication, and
   professional communication are potentially overlapping disciplines with
   open disciplinary questions. A comparative topical analysis of research
   topics can identify similarities and differences between them,
   addressing intellectual and physical concerns for each. Literature
   review: Recent topical analyses have been done for technical
   communication. Historical topical analyses have been done for business
   communication. Few professional communication topical analyses exist.
   Some studies were done 15 or more years ago, and one related comparative
   study exists. Research questions: 1. What research topics are unique to
   each of the disciplines of technical communication, business
   communication, and professional communication in a corpus of research
   abstracts spanning 1963-2017? 2. What topics are shared among the
   disciplines of technical communication, business communication, and
   professional communication in a corpus of research abstracts spanning
   1963-2017? Research methodology: I used collocation analysis on the
   target phrases technical communication, business communication, and
   professional communication from a 4822-abstract corpus. I compared words
   collocated with target phrases to find words unique to a single term,
   those shared with two terms, or those shared with all three terms.
   Results/discussion: Findings identified science communication as a
   technical communication topic; other findings corroborated previous
   research. Business communication findings corroborated previous research
   and identified an emphasis on global communication. Findings show
   professional communication as a rhetorically flexible term that creates
   a space for emerging concepts and expands disciplinary boundaries. The
   three shared communication, pedagogy, international, and disciplinary
   concerns. Conclusions: The disciplines feature some overlap but maintain
   distinct research foci. Professional communication is a distinctive
   discipline that assists technical communication and business
   communication by incubation of emerging concepts.},

Title = {Global Technical Communication in 7.5 Weeks Online: Combining Industry
   and Academic Perspectives},

Abstract = {Introduction: With the growing need for intensive and online course
   formats, it has become increasingly difficult to determine what
   combinations of knowledge and skills that are important for both
   academia and industry can best provide students with the grounding for
   exploring the questions of global technical communication (TC) during
   their programs. About the case: The 7.5-week online global TC course at
   Arizona State University is divided into six theme-based units and a
   unit that focuses on a research/ revision project. Situating the case:
   While over the last 20 years, excellent practical materials for teaching
   global TC have been published, there is a need for comprehensive course
   descriptions, particularly for courses in online and intensive formats.
   Methods/approach: The course was based on an extensive literature review
   of academic and trade publications. The course's effectiveness was
   analyzed based on final reflective discussion assignments and anonymous
   student course evaluations. Results/discussion: The literature review
   revealed six major themes that define global TC: culture and
   communication, the frameworks of culture, verbal communication, global
   content and technology, visual communication, and cross-cultural
   collaboration and audience work. Each unit addressed one of these
   themes. The course was well-received, and students started posing
   critical questions to explore in future courses. Conclusions: In our
   program, having a dedicated global TC course was very beneficial because
   it introduced students to concepts that they could further explore in
   other 7.5-week online courses. In addition, I present recommendations
   for adopting/ adapting the course, as well as its limitations and
   suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {Research problem: In light of the growing popularity of LinkedIn as a
   self-promotional tool for the job search process, this paper examines
   the rhetorical structure of LinkedIn Summaries. Research questions: (1)
   Which rhetorical moves are found in the Summary sections of LinkedIn
   profiles? (2) Do the Summary sections display similar patterns of
   textual organization? (3) What strategies do the writers of the Summary
   sections deploy to achieve these rhetorical moves? Literature review:
   This paper has a genre analytic theoretical orientation of approach,
   whose underlying assumption is that genres sharing the same purposes and
   context of use are likely to have similar organizational patterns and to
   deploy similar strategies to achieve these purposes. Previous research
   on LinkedIn has focused on characteristics of the service and its impact
   on interactions, but not as a medium used in the classroom. A much
   deeper literature exists on job application letters, which concludes
   that a job application uses similar rhetorical moves, or discoursal
   units that perform distinct communicative functions, to a sales
   promotion letter. The moves include: introducing candidature,
   establishing credentials, essential detailing of candidature, indicating
   value of candidature, offering incentives, enclosing documents, using
   pressure tactics, soliciting response, and ending politely. Methodology:
   It is a study that analyzed the rhetorical structure of LinkedIn
   Summaries of 50 professional resume writers in the US from a genre
   analytic perspective. Results and conclusions: The LinkedIn Summary
   shares many moves in common with the job application letter. Moves that
   were found in all or nearly all of the texts were establishing
   credentials, identifying target market and detailing service; an
   additional move, not seen in job application letters, was also
   identified-that of personal branding. However, a rigid organizational
   structure was not seen. The results and the methodology used to obtain
   them will be of use to students and others wishing to use LinkedIn to
   promote themselves to potential employers. The study is limited to one
   particular professional group in one region, but there is ample scope
   for further research looking at LinkedIn profiles in other professions
   and other parts of the world.},

Title = {A Tale of Four Functions in a Multifunctional Device: Extending
   Implementation Intention Theory},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research problem: This study examines functions in a multifunctional
   device, the smartphone. Specifically, it explores (1) to what extent
   does the theory of planned behavior capture user evaluation of different
   functions? (2) to what extent does pleasure have positive effects on
   intentions of different functions? (3) to what extent could the
   implementation intention theory identify the important functions?
   Literature review: To answer these questions, we look at the Theory of
   Planned Behavior which has been used to examine a single function device
   and test the predictability of the theory for a multifunctional system.
   We also review the Implementation Intention Theory and test the
   predictability of the theory for identifying important functions.
   Methodology: A quantitative survey of more than 200 smartphone owners in
   information-technology shopping malls and customer service centers for
   major smartphone brands was conducted. Results: The results from the
   data collected show that the theory of planned behavior and the
   additional pleasure construct explain more than 50\% of the variance in
   intentions. The effect of pleasure on intention varies from one function
   to another. In general, pleasure shows much stronger effects for
   high-hedonic functions than for low-hedonic functions. In addition, the
   Implementation Intention Theory reveals that phone and organizer are the
   most important functions. Implications: These results contribute to
   research on multifunctional systems and communication technology, the
   Theory of Planned Behavior, the Implementation Intention Theory, and to
   the practitioners. However, the results of this study may be somewhat
   limited to users in a modern city. Future research could extend this
   study to include a task dimension, to compare different technologies and
   their functions, and to look at modality preferences.},

Title = {Assessing the Impact of Student Peer Review in Writing Instruction by
   Using the Normalized Compression Distance},

Abstract = {Research Problem: Studies identify peer review as an effective
   instructional method to improve student writing. Some teachers, however,
   avoid peer review, perhaps due to the workload required for assessing
   and correcting peer reviews. Previous studies have not proposed any
   method to reduce teacher workload by using an objective means to analyze
   the effects of peer review. Research Questions: This study assesses the
   degree of similarity between student essay drafts using normalized
   compression distance (NCD), a compression-based classification
   algorithm. How does peer review affect student essays, as measured by
   the NCD? What were the changes in essay length and holistic scores? How
   did students respond to peer essays? How did peer review affect students
   during revision? What were the NCD results? How did holistic scoring
   correspond to NCD results? Literature Review: Studies of pharmacists and
   engineers indicate that English language technical communication skills
   are important. Studies of peer review in language education indicate
   that peer comments are valuable but cultural differences and lack of
   confidence may impede making or using comments. Studies of NCD applied
   to web data, figures, and images indicate useful results. Methodology:
   This quantitative study used anonymous peer review and compared the
   results of traditional holistic scoring against a novel NCD measure. The
   researchers conducted the study with 35 student volunteers at a
   pharmaceutical university in Tokyo, Japan. The students had at least
   nine years of previous English instruction and previous peer-review
   experience. In class, students wrote an essay, anonymously reviewed a
   peer's essay according to instructions, then revised their own essays
   based on peer comments. An assessor graded the two drafts using a
   holistic scoring rubric. The researchers used NCD to quantify the change
   between drafts. Results and Discussion: Sixty percent of revisions
   contained more words than the originals. 51\% percent of revisions
   received higher scores, 40\% had no change, and 8.5\% percent had
   reduced scores. Eleven percent of reviewers with low English proficiency
   did not identify obvious errors. Three revised essays had lower grades
   because the writers did not know how to incorporate peer comments.
   Anonymous peer review could lead to poor results where students had poor
   reviewing skills or did not know how to use peer comments. NCD helps
   teachers identify which revised essays to re-evaluate after peer review
   by indicating those with large quantities of changes. The study was
   limited by its small group of participants. Future research will examine
   longer essays, more participants, varied backgrounds, web delivery of
   NCD, and finding more factors to indicate the quality of written work to
   reduce teacher workload.},

Abstract = {Organizations are using virtual communities to facilitate knowledge
   management and to enhance communication among employees, customers, and
   other interested individuals. Individual users can use virtual
   communities to engage in knowledge sharing. Professional communicators
   need to understand and adapt to a globalized and ``flat{''} world, where
   people across different cultures interact freely and easily with one
   another in virtual communities. An intriguing question regarding virtual
   communities relates to whether national culture affects communication
   and types of knowledge sharing. This study examines the influence of US
   and Chinese national cultures on types of knowledge-sharing activities
   in virtual communities. The findings indicate that national culture
   differences between China and the US are also evident in virtual
   community environments.},

Abstract = {This paper opens with a summary of minimalist design strategies that aim
   to optimize user instructions. Next, it discusses three recent research
   efforts to further improve these strategies. The common focus in these
   efforts is the attention to people's goal-related management and control
   of attention, time, and effort. First, a comprehensive framework for
   designing procedures-the Four Components model-is described. The design
   principles for the goal component focus on supporting the user's goal
   orientation and goal setting. Second, two experiments are reported that
   studied the problem of when it is best to present conceptual
   information. When instructions employed a learning-by-doing approach,
   users clearly preferred a work-flow mode of presentation. This mode
   optimally exploits the user's momentary interest in conceptual
   information during goal-driven task execution. The third research effort
   concentrates on user affect in instructions. The main idea is that
   motivation and emotion play a key role in task appraisals and
   corresponding actions. After discussing theories and design approaches,
   an experiment is discussed in which instructions were optimized for
   affect. Good results for perceived relevance and self-confidence were
   found in all conditions. Presence of an affect-oriented co-user did not
   enhance these effects. The paper concludes that the contribution of the
   efforts extends beyond the minimalist framework from which they
   originated.},

Abstract = {The article presents a cross-case comparison of experiences from
   organizational adoption and use of e-collaboration technologies in two
   large global companies. Challenges in the global implementation process
   were found to increase with the organizational and geographical scope of
   the implementation, Level of autonomy in the adoption process, cultural
   diversity, technological heterogeneity, and level of work process
   support embedded in the system. Alignment with existing collaborative
   work practices resulted in faster adoption of the technological
   solution. Highly competitive conditions restricted the resources
   available for training and experience transfer between projects.
   Clients' preferences for co-located project operations served as a
   potential barrier to the very concept of global e-collaboration. The
   study increases our understanding of the adoption and use of permanent
   e-collaboration infrastructures at the organizational level, thus
   expanding the focus of global e-collaboration research beyond the level
   of ad hoc, virtual teams.},

Abstract = {In this qualitative content analysis, I examined 55 articles with
   keywords relating to collaboration published in the 1990-1999 issues of
   five major technical communication journals. I considered the frequency,
   types of research, and themes in the 55-article collection. My analysis
   reveals differences in the authors' discussions of collaboration
   depending on whether the collaboration occurred in the classroom or the
   workplace. I also found that most of the 55 articles were more,
   concerned with collaborative practice than with theoretical discussions
   of collaboration. Suggestions for future research include investigating
   how experienced workplace collaborators and experienced teachers of
   collaborative skills in technical communication courses solve the
   nonroutine problems that occur when practice becomes difficult. From
   these investigations, researchers might determine what constitutes
   expertise in collaboration.},

Title = {Minimalism for the Win: User-Centered Design for Guidance in Industrial
   Maintenance},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Background: We conducted an exploratory study to test the delivery of
   technical instructions built on the principles of minimalism. The aim
   was to investigate how we could support target users' skill levels in a
   context-sensitive manner. Literature review: Related work examines
   minimalism, user needs and profiling, and industrial maintenance and
   technician experience. Research questions: 1. How can the semantic
   structure of DITA XML be utilized in delivering technical information to
   users based on their skill levels? 2. How would a layered system of
   information support the principles of minimalism? Methodology: We
   created material and tested the concept in user studies with maintenance
   personnel in three countries. We collected feedback through participant
   observation, interviews, and questionnaires. Results and discussion: The
   minimalist approach of delivering information to maintenance technicians
   was well received and supported users with varying skill levels.
   Conclusion: The context-sensitive level of expertise concept empowers
   users to decide on the depth of technical information that they require
   to complete the task at hand. The semantic structure of DITA XML works
   well in the delivery of technical information to the users based on
   their skill levels. Many of the key principles of minimalism are
   applicable to hardware maintenance instructions.},

Title = {A Re-Examination of Fortune 500 Homepage Design Practices},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-44},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research problem: As a follow up to an earlier article, this study
   compares Fortune 500 website homepage design in 2013 with the results of
   a similar study in 2008, providing an updated overview of homepage
   design practice that reflects the many technological advances that have
   influenced web design during the intervening period. The findings are
   useful for those wanting to know the state of homepage design in 2013,
   whether as current practitioners or researchers. Research questions: (1)
   What are the current homepage design practices of Fortune 500 companies?
   (2) What are the current Web 2.0 technology practices of Fortune 500
   companies? (3) What changes in homepage design have occurred for Fortune
   500 companies? (4) What are the differences in homepage design and Web
   2.0 technology practices between the 100 largest and 100 smallest
   Fortune 500 companies? and (5) Is homogeneity in design increasing
   amongst Fortune 500 homepages? Literature review: Three key areas guided
   my analysis of homepages. (1) Usability research, which suggests
   guidelines for design based on aggregated performance of users, such as
   locating the search box in the upper right and for directing mobile
   users to an alternate site designed for mobile access. (2) Design
   practice studies, which suggest guidelines for design based on
   aggregated analyses of websites, such as having links to employment
   information and investor information on the homepage. (3) Design
   patterns: libraries of patterns to provide designers with responses to
   design problems, such as using collapsible panels or module tabs to
   reveal and conceal content on a page. These libraries also provide
   guidelines for design, such as using fat menus or sitemap footers to
   structure navigation. Methodology: Using content analysis, every Fortune
   500 homepage in 2013 was analyzed for 68 major design elements in these
   categories--navigation, content links, support for specific types of
   users, visual design, multimedia, and web 2.0-and the results were
   analyzed. Results and conclusions: The homepages displayed greater
   homogeneity in design than a similar study in 2008. Overall, 12
   elements-(1) corporate logo in the top left of the page; (2) link to an
   ``about us{''} section containing company information; (3) link to
   information for those seeking employment; (4) horizontally oriented main
   navigation; (5) link for contacting the company; (6) link for
   information for investors; (7) link for terms of use or legal
   disclaimers; (8) link to privacy information; (9) link for news or a
   press room; (10) multimedia use; (11) links that do not appear on the
   page initially, requiring interaction; (12) search box, located in the
   upper right of page-were present on 80\% or more homepages, and 6
   elements-(1) web 2.0 features; (2) an image that can be clicked on as a
   focal point; (3) link to a sitemap; (4) link to Twitter; (5) link to
   Facebook; and (6) dropdown or pulldown menu-were present on 50\% to 79\%
   of pages. Between 2008 and 2013, many practices have changed, such as
   increases in page length, the overall number of links, the number of
   links to social media sites, and the number of sites with search boxes.
   Certain design choices-such as mobile options for sites, links to social
   media sites, and links to site maps-were more prevalent in the largest
   100 companies than the smallest 100 companies.},

   Building and Testing Behavioral Causal Theory: When to Choose It and How

Abstract = {Problem: Partial least squares (PLS), a form of structural equation
   modeling (SEM), can provide much value for causal inquiry in
   communication-related and behavioral research fields. Despite the wide
   availability of technical information on PLS, many behavioral and
   communication researchers often do not use PLS in situations in which it
   could provide unique theoretical insights. Moreover, complex models
   comprising formative (causal) and reflective (consequent) constructs are
   now common in behavioral research, but they are often misspecified in
   statistical models, resulting in erroneous tests. Key concepts:
   First-generation (1G) techniques, such as correlations, regressions, or
   difference of means tests (such as ANOVA or t-tests), offer limited
   modeling capabilities, particularly in terms of causal modeling. In
   contrast, second-generation techniques (such as covariance-based SEM or
   PLS) offer extensive, scalable, and flexible causal-modeling
   capabilities. Second-generation (2G) techniques do not invalidate the
   need for 1G techniques however. The key point of 2G techniques is that
   they are superior for the complex causal modeling that dominates recent
   communication and behavioral research. Key lessons: For exploratory
   work, or for studies that include formative constructs, PLS should be
   selected. For confirmatory work, either covariance-based SEM or PLS may
   be used. Despite claims that lower sampling requirements exist for PLS,
   inadequate sample sizes result in the same problems for either
   technique. Implications: SEM's strength is in modeling. In particular,
   SEM allows for complex models that include latent (unobserved)
   variables, formative variables, chains of effects (mediation), and
   multiple group comparisons of these more complex relationships.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Despite the increasing interests raised by incident
   reporting systems, it is still unclear what dimensions of user
   experience (UX) and other contextual factors should be taken into
   account for the various stages of declaring an incident using
   mobile-phone applications. Research questions: How do citizens perceive
   and describe urban incidents? What UX dimensions are important for
   reporting an incident with a mobile-phone application? What other
   (contextual) factors are important from the users' point of view when
   declaring incidents? Which of the UX dimensions and contextual factors
   are important when in the various phases during an incident declaration?
   Literature review: Overall, there is a lack of empirical research in the
   domain of incident reporting. In general, the UX dimensions-visual and
   aesthetic experience, emotion, stimulation, identification, meaning and
   value, and social relatedness/coexperience-are important when designing
   interactive systems. It also shows that incidents are related to the
   citizen's perception of the environment. Methodology: A triangulated
   method approach combining interviews, a survey of existing systems, and
   a model-based task analysis were applied. This allows us to present a
   generic task model for incident reporting with a detailed description of
   UX dimensions affected in the various subtasks. Results and conclusions:
   Our findings point out the effect of UX dimensions in the task engaged
   by users when reporting urban citizens. The overall UX is directly
   influenced by the perceived level of severity, inconvenience and
   involvement, the personal context, and the technological mobile context.
   We have found that while several UX dimensions are highly relevant, they
   are not equally distributed along the several subtasks that citizens
   engage when reporting incidents. This study shows that semistructured
   requirement interviews can provide information about UX dimensions and
   it highlights the importance of the identification of UX dimensions in
   early phases of the development process.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {The introduction of international financial reporting regulations has
   caused European multinationals to be increasingly reliant on the
   nonfinancial multimodal sections of the annual report as a means of
   informing and persuading international stakeholders. Due to the growing
   status of English as an international financial communication language,
   moreover, these annual report sections are usually produced in English.
   This experimental study compares the effectiveness of texts and photos
   in Dutch-English and British-English management statements from the
   perspective of financial analysts in the UK. The research results
   largely confirm the similarity-attraction hypothesis: Among UK-based
   analysts, typically British communication features often yield a more
   positive effect than the features that are typical of the Dutch-based
   statements.},

Abstract = {By integrating Media Richness Theory, Channel Expansion Theory, and the
   Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we study the postadoption use
   behavior of instant messaging. We developed the construct ``use
   richness{''} as a measure of the extent to which users use the media
   communication capacity after adoption and proposed a conceptual model of
   the antecedents of use richness. Through a field survey with 272 valid
   responses and structural equation modeling, we empirically tested our
   model and found that use richness is positively affected by perceived
   media richness, perceived usefulness, and perceived social usefulness.},

Abstract = {Although listening is valued in engineering education literature, it is
   conspicuously absent from engineering curricula. Using interview data,
   data from published literature, reflective instructional experiences,
   and the intersection of those three data sources, this study
   investigates two primary issues: (1) engineering students' sources of
   resistance to listening instruction in a sustainable community
   development initiative, and (2) benefits from such instruction. Findings
   feature a proposed theory of contextual listening and suggest that
   sources of resistance include the paucity of listening instruction in
   the engineering curriculum and curricular components that may devalue
   listening. Benefits of a listening intervention are described, and
   implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the effects of publisher contact information on the
   credibility of online health information. Participants (n = 144) rated
   the credibility of webpages with a ``Contact Us{''} link more highly
   than pages that had no contact information. Other types of contact
   information (street addresses and email links) did not significantly
   affect the credibility ratings. Qualitative results indicate that the
   ``Contact Us{''} link served as a peripheral cue to credibility, rather
   than triggering conscious analysis. This paper also discusses how the
   effectiveness of credibility cues can vary according to reader
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {We examine the role of face-to-face meetings in the context of
   technology-supported self-organizing distributed (or virtual teams),
   specifically Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development teams.
   Based on a qualitative inductive analysis of data from interviews and
   observations at FLOSS conferences, we identify a variety of settings in
   which developers meet face-to-face, and we point out the activities
   performed in these settings and the benefits obtained. Contrary to
   conventional wisdom about distributed teams, FLOSS developers generally
   do not meet face-to-face until the project is well under way. An
   additional benefit offace-to-face meetings is time away from a regular
   job and speed of interaction for certain kinds of tasks.},

Title = {Distress Coping Responses Among Teleworkers},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-283},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of teleworking
   has risen. Telework seems poised to remain popular even after the
   pandemic fades away. As a result, it is important to understand the
   humanistic effects of telework such as distress, coping responses, and
   related effects. Literature review: Uncertainties related to telework
   can lead to distress. When this occurs, teleworkers may employ a variety
   of coping responses, which vary across several important dimensions.
   These coping responses vary in the extent to which they affect telework
   outcomes. Research questions: 1. What strategies do teleworkers use for
   dealing with telework distress? 2. How are various coping strategies
   related to humanistic telework outcomes? Methodology: Data from a survey
   of 504 American teleworkers were used to test a theoretical model.
   Results: Results suggest that teleworkers cope with telework distress
   through assistance seeking, technology experimentation, venting, and
   negative and positive emotions. Coping responses had differential
   effects on telework exhaustion and satisfaction, with negative and
   positive emotions and venting affecting exhaustion, and assistance
   seeking, task experimentation, emotions, and venting affecting
   satisfaction. Distress had a direct effect on exhaustion, but not on
   satisfaction. Conclusion: The effects of emotion-focused coping on
   telework satisfaction and exhaustion are notably stronger than those of
   problem-focused coping responses. Emotion-focused coping responses that
   are adaptive have beneficial effects, while those that are maladaptive
   have detrimental effects. Adaptive problem-focused responses have
   similar effects. The extent of communication focus does not seem to
   affect the impact of coping responses on outcomes.},

Abstract = {Research problem: This study investigates the way in which large Chinese
   firms communicated occupational fatalities in corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) reports. Research questions: 1. Did the sample
   firms disclose information about workplace fatalities in their CSR
   reports? 2. What communicative strategies were used in the disclosure
   for the purpose of self-legitimation? 3. How were these strategies
   manifested linguistically and rhetorically? Literature review: The study
   is based on legitimacy theory, which suggests that when reporting bad
   news, firms may use communicative strategies to maintain or restore
   organizational legitimacy. Previous studies of negative CSR disclosures
   focus more on information selection and omission than on information
   presentation. A lack of consideration of actual organizational
   performance in some studies also makes it less feasible to account for
   strategies that firms use to misrepresent reality. Methodology: The
   study compared CSR reports issued by Fortune 500 Chinese firms with the
   firms' reports of fatal occupational incidents to see whether the
   incidents were reported faithfully. An integrated analytical framework
   of legitimation strategies, developed from previous studies of
   legitimation in organizational communication, was applied to the
   analysis. Results and conclusions: Most firms disclosed their fatality
   incidents. Legitimation strategies-in particular, positive performance
   evaluations and corrective actions-were used by the firms to
   de-emphasize or minimize the bad news. This study calls for greater
   attention from CSR monitors and professionals to information
   presentation as an important indicator of report quality. The findings
   are limited to one type of CSR disclosure and to the firms that were
   examined.},

Abstract = {Background: This paper offers a hybrid, place-based ethic drawn from
   multiple perspectives as a way to reinvigorate ethical thought for
   technical communicators. Literature review: Aldo Leopold's land ethic
   asks us to consider actions beyond our immediate surroundings. Martin
   Buber's dialogic ethics complement a land ethic and interrogate
   interpersonal communication. Anticipatory technology ethics recommends
   the integration of ethical discussions and decisions during the design
   phase of new technologies. Together, these three approaches inform a
   place-based ethic for technical communicators. Research questions: 1.
   How might we meaningfully merge the many ways that technical
   communicators from varying backgrounds approach ethics into a useful
   ethical model that considers human interaction, technological
   innovation, and physical place? 2. How might such a merged model, what
   we call a place-based ethic, affect technical communication design?
   Methods: We analyze cases including documents from radical environmental
   defense groups, a restyling of certain federal court rules from legalese
   into plainer language, the creation of mortgage documents suitable for
   consumers and industry professionals, and the action-research design
   phase of a locative mobile application about public art. Results and
   conclusion: The cases provide concrete examples of the components of a
   place-based ethic, and we conclude that designing with a place-based
   ethic includes actively acknowledging the value of the environment,
   seeking areas for dialogue among involved parties and celebrating
   dialogue where it occurs, seeking shared spaces, clearly stating
   anticipated outcomes, and usability testing for potential ethical
   issues.},

Abstract = {This case study reports on the experiences of designing and assessing
   the effectiveness of a faculty development program on writing across the
   curriculum (WAC). The report focuses on the question: What are the key
   components of an effective faculty development program to integrate WAC
   into engineering and scientific courses taught by faculty in those
   disciplines? Situating the case: Two main models of WAC implementation
   exist: direct instruction, which uses writing specialists to deliver
   instruction to engineering and science students, and the
   department-centered model, which instructs faculty in engineering and
   scientific disciplines to teach writing as part of technical courses.
   How the case was studied: A report of the experiences of the authors and
   the feedback from the participants. About the case: The workshop was
   aimed at teachers in various disciplines and covered these main topics:
   fundamentals of writing theory and pedagogy, writing assignment design
   and assessment, and situating writing assignments in courses across the
   disciplinary curriculum. It took place over 10 weeks during a 15-week
   semester and included large-and small-group meetings, consultations with
   the members of the university WAC program, and peer review of writing
   assignment drafts. Conclusions, limitations, and suggestions for future
   research: Key challenges in developing the workshop included designing
   ways to bridge the conceptual gap between the participants' and WAC
   instructors' understanding of the role of writing in disciplinary
   courses, limited time available to the participants, and scheduling
   challenges. The workshop was given seven times. Most of the faculty
   participants (90\%) generally found it to be very effective or
   effective. Studies of workshops with larger populations of trainees are
   suggested.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-164},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Problem: Increased demand for user experience (UX) designers requires
   new approaches to teaching and training the next generation of these
   professionals. We present a model for building educational programs
   within academia that train job-ready designers. Key concepts: To be
   successful, this model necessitates a working knowledge of the UX
   process, the systematic use of sound principles during the design of
   digital products and services. The model also requires a pedagogical
   approach that puts learners in a position to solve real problems and
   that treats them as apprentices on their way to competency. Key lessons:
   Academic institutions clearly have parts to play in producing job-ready
   UX designers, but barriers exist to doing so, including access to
   adequate training in UX best practices. To overcome these barriers, we
   provide tips for understanding core UX competencies, developing
   partnerships with UX practitioners, and deploying UX education courses
   and programs. Implications: Though the barriers to producing sufficient
   numbers of well-trained UX designers are significant, the combined
   ingenuity of devoted professionals in both academia and industry can be
   leveraged to create sound educational opportunities for UX learners from
   all walks of life.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the use of the dialogic communication model to teach
   students how to write a report introduction. In the case study
   presented, the students engaged in discussions and reflections regarding
   the contextual complexities in the writers' and readers' organizational
   environments, which helped them adapt their writing to their readers'
   needs and thought processes. The thinking process that students go
   through in making their writing more reader centered using this model
   could be a useful springboard to help students adopt the thinking
   processes of professional engineers.},

Abstract = {Why does a team member prefer some colleagues to others in information
   seeking? Past literature suggests that the physical accessibility of a
   knowledge source, the information quality of the source, and relational
   concerns influence such a choice. This study extends past literature by
   suggesting that formal structural factors are also important.
   Particularly, job interdependence, competition, and supervisory
   relationships are hypothesized to affect information-sourcing frequency.
   Our social-network analysis of an information systems project team
   indicates that formal structural factors are important to the
   development of informal networks and the perception of the information
   quality of a source. They have direct and indirect impacts on sourcing
   behavior. Implications for information systems project management are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Arguably, usability testing is most effective when integrated into the
   user-centered design process. One way to encourage this integration is
   to reemphasize the value of paper prototyping. In a recent test of a
   university library website, we married low-fidelity paper prototyping
   with medium-fidelity wireframe prototyping. When user navigation led to
   nonexisting pages or dead ends, users were encouraged to create what
   they thought should be where there was nothing. This blank-page
   technique gave us insights into users' mental models regarding site
   content and design, providing developers with useful data concerning how
   users conceptualized information they encountered.},

Abstract = {The current trend of increasing instant messaging (IM) use and its
   potential growth motivate this study. it offers a novel exploration of
   users' preferences for IM in the context of the use of other traditional
   and new communication media: face-to-face, telephone, email, and short
   messaging service (SMS) in two distinct cultures: Australia and China.
   It examines the impact of demographics, media experience, media richness
   perception, and national culture on media preferences. Our results,
   based on a student survey conducted in the two countries, show that
   women prefer IM for communication activities that require more attention
   and personal presence and prefer email,for communication activities that
   require less personal presence. Communication technology experience may
   predict the adoption of new technology, such as IM and SMS, but has no
   effect on media that are already widely adopted, such as email. Email
   was clustered with face-to-face and telephone as the most preferred
   media for any communication activity, while IM and SMS clustered
   together and were the least preferred media for Communication. After
   controlling for demographics and media experience, we found significant
   cultural differences in IM, telephone, and email preferences. Chinese
   preferred to use IM and telephone, while Australians preferred to use
   email. The cultural impact on technology use is persistent.},

Abstract = {The visual rhetoric of data displays (e.g., charts, graphs, maps) has
   changed profoundly over the past 50 years as a result of research in
   display techniques, the application of traditional and emerging
   rhetorical approaches, and the democratizing effects of data design
   technology. Perhaps in no other visual realm than data design is the
   notion of, clarity more critical or more contested. Indeed the
   ascendancy of rhetorical approaches was initiated by the
   perceptual/cognitive science of data design, which in seeking to
   identify optimal display techniques, fostered a concern for ethics and
   evoked the universality and minimalism of modernist aesthetics. The
   rhetoric of adaptation, which emphasizes the variability of audiences,
   purposes, and situational contexts, rendered clarity contingent and.
   mutable-a moving target that requires constant attention. Social
   rhetoric considered data design as a collective construct, tethering
   clarity to visual discourse communities, convention-building, cultural
   values, and power. The concept of clarity has been further reoriented by
   the rhetoric of participation, which is fostered by interactive digital
   design that enables users to adapt displays according to their. needs
   and interests.},

Abstract = {This study explored strengths and limitations of table formatting
   choices by engaging twenty-eight participants in information searches in
   online tables, presented on a small-screen, interface (Palm IIIc). Table
   length across conditions was held constant at three screens long (24
   rows total) but varied from one to three screens wide (approximately 35,
   70, and 105 characters per-line). Target information was positioned in
   either the upper left, lower left, upper right, or lower right
   quadrants. Data collected. were time on task, error rate, and level of
   participants' confidence in their answers. Experimenters found that
   increased horizontal scrolling imposed the heaviest burden on
   information search. This study supports restricting table widths to one
   screen on handheld computers. If necessary, however, tables can go to
   two screens wide without critical detriment to usability. While ruled
   line formatting is slightly better than interface character,in providing
   visual support for the burden of horizontal scrolling, neither
   formatting option adequately compensates for the added burden.},

Abstract = {Problem: This tutorial aims to guide readers through key concepts, basic
   processes, and common decision points that inform computer-assisted
   corpus-based research in technical, professional, and scientific
   communication (TPSC). Key lessons: These key concepts can be used to
   establish basic processes and decision points that, in turn, yield
   lessons related to the usefulness of lexicogrammatical language models
   and the significance of multidisciplinarity. Implications: Although
   corpus research is a growing and important part of the field of TPSC,
   challenges remain in terms of language model variety and ethical
   considerations. At least in part, these challenges can be met,
   respectively, by alignment between corpus and analytic tools and
   reference to the Common Rule and related international standards.},

Abstract = {Background: Building a reputable network on Twitter is viewed as
   impactful in several scholarly disciplines, but little is known about
   the professional and interdisciplinary human-computer interaction (HCI)
   community. This study combined two approaches from scholarly
   communication and technical communication to capture the static and
   dynamic features of the HCI scholar Twitter network. Literature review:
   Related studies that described the scholarly reputation built through
   Twitter and social networking in the field of HCI were reviewed and
   discussed. Research questions: 1. In which countries are HCI scholars
   more likely to follow their peers in the same country? 2. What are the
   characteristics (country, reputation) and actions (reciprocity) of HCI
   scholars who are more likely to build HCI scholarly network profiles on
   Twitter? Research methodology: The network analysis method of the
   exponential random graph model (ERGM) was adopted to trace and visualize
   current follower networks on Twitter. Results and discussion: We found
   that 22.9\% of HCI scholars use Twitter and that reciprocity and country
   of current employment best drive the Twitter connections of scholars.
   Characteristics of HCI scholars' tie formation online are also
   illustrated and discussed. Implications for practice: This study
   contributes to field studies of professional networks by identifying the
   structural properties and factors that influence scholars' search for
   professional development on Twitter. The empirical findings should be a
   helpful reference for HCI professional societies and individual scholars
   in operating online professional networks.},

Abstract = {Background: More than 30 years ago, Harmon distinguished developmental
   research articles (RAs), which propose a solution to a problem, from
   experimental RAs, but the developmental format has received little
   attention. Literature review: Genre analysis of RAs has been largely
   restricted to articles following the standard experimental/Introduction,
   Methods, Results, Discussion (IMRD) format, thereby excluding many
   developmental engineering articles. Recently, a textbook proposed
   Introduction, Process, Testing, Conclusion (IPTC) as a prototypical
   format for electrical engineering RAs, but this format has not yet been
   demonstrated from a corpus. Research questions: 1. What is the
   macrostructure of electrical engineering RAs? 2. What are the
   characteristic features of each division of electrical engineering RAs?
   Methodology: Section headings, wordcount, and notable features were
   analyzed for 75 RAs from 15 electrical engineering journals and compared
   with both IPTC and Harmon's developmental structure. Results: Only one
   article, a case study, followed IMRD. Sixty-seven developmental RAs
   followed the IPTC format. These are distinguished by the second division
   (P), where the new solution is described, written in extended style,
   comprising several sections with headings specific to the research. A
   paragraph at the end of the Introduction describing the organization of
   the paper, the location of the theoretical framework and testing
   methods, and a ubiquitous Conclusion also differ from IMRD. Seven
   developmental RAs exhibited a hybrid format with the well-known IMRD
   section headings superimposed on an IPTC structure. Conclusions: Most
   electrical engineering articles are developmental and follow IPTC
   format. This can inform future genre analysis research and has
   pedagogical implications for teaching engineering writing.},

Title = {Internet-Mediated Genre Studies: An Integrative Literature Review
   (2005-2019)},

Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Background: As all sorts of communications have substantially moved to
   the internet, volumes of literature on internet-mediated communication
   have emerged in professional and technical communication in different
   research paradigms, including studies on internet-mediated genres, which
   often have generic features beyond traditional conception and thus
   require updated understanding. This study systematically explores the
   emerging body of internet-mediated genre studies and identifies the
   specific genres that researchers have studied, the analytical components
   and research methods used, and conclusions reached to characterize the
   current state of the research. Research questions: 1. Which
   internet-mediated genres have been studied in existing literature
   (2005-2019)? 2. What affordances have been considered in existing
   studies on internet-mediated genres? 3. Which research methods have been
   used to study internet-mediated genres? Literature review: Major issues
   affecting prior studies of internet-mediated genres include inconsistent
   terminology used by researchers, the ways that affordances are
   considered, and the inadequacies of current genre analysis methods to
   explain features arising from those affordances. Methodology: Employing
   an integrative literature review, we conducted a systematic search
   resulting in 35 qualified studies published in journals indexed in the
   Social Sciences Citation Index between 2005 and 2019. Each was
   systematically analyzed to identify the genre addressed, communicative
   goal, medium, affordances addressed, and research methods used.
   Results/discussion: Three main types of internet-mediated
   genres-including email, website, and social media, and several
   subtypes-were identified, each distinguished by their medium and
   communicative goal. The affordances were either treated monomodally,
   mentioned as contextual information, or integrated into the analytical
   framework. Researchers relied on a variety of methods to study
   internet-mediated genres, with mixed methods most commonly used.
   Conclusions and further research: The data show that both the genres of
   interest and methods used to study them vary with time, suggesting that
   this area of research continues to evolve. Future studies could probe
   into a larger variety of internet-mediated genres with more diverse
   analytical components and methods.},

Abstract = {Background: Although effective communication has been the most important
   attribute of success in the workplace, poor communication has hindered
   employees from performing well. This outcome worsens when communication
   occurs between cross-generational groups in an organization. Literature
   review: Prior research suggests that Millennials, who make up a large
   cohort of the population in workplaces, are technologically savvy,
   multitasking, and result-oriented but considered to be deficient in
   their communication skills. There exists a divergence between
   Millennials and previous generations in terms of their attitude,
   behavior, and value system. Research questions: 1. Is there a
   significant difference in the communication styles of Millennials and
   their predecessors in India? 2. Are Millennials communication deficient?
   3. Do their Gen X predecessors lack the skills to recognize different
   generational preferences in order to effectively lead a
   multigenerational workforce? Research methodology: For this
   investigation, a 36-item questionnaire measured 12 interpersonal styles
   through three items each on a Likert-type scale. Results: The results
   presented in this study are not limited to generational stereotyping but
   rather claim to be accurate and context-sensitive. Millennials defied
   general stereotypes in several ways. The findings confirmed that
   although Millennials are different, they are not necessarily
   communication deficient. Conclusion: To flourish, Millennials and their
   predecessor and successor generations should strive to adapt to each
   other by avoiding stereotypes.},

Abstract = {Background: The primary goal of the current study was to conceptualize
   and operationalize social networking sites (SNS) skills for
   communication professionals. Literature review: The development of the
   definition and measurement instrument began with a critical look at
   internet skills literature. We propose a three-fold instrument for
   measuring SNS skills: communication, content creation, and strategic SNS
   skills. Research questions: 1. Which skills do communication
   professionals need to effectively use SNS? 2. Which SNS use-related
   factors contribute to the level of SNS skills? Method: We ensured that
   the proposed measures reflected typical SNS uses for communication
   professionals. All items in the instrument used a scale that contained
   statements about SNS skills, with answer formats that ranged from ``Not
   at all true of me{''} to ``Very true of me.{''} After the development of
   a first survey instrument, we conducted cognitive interviews that
   resulted in some amendments to the proposed skill items to improve
   clarity. The SNS skill scales and their characteristics were then tested
   in a pilot study. Results: The resulting instrument was refined in the
   final study among 203 German communication professionals. Conclusion:
   The findings suggest a recommendation for the use of a 15-item survey
   measure for communication, content creation, and strategic SNS skills in
   professional contexts. Our findings furthermore suggest that
   communication and content creation SNS skills are better developed than
   strategic SNS skills. Finally, several SNS use variables were identified
   as predictors of SNS skills.},

Title = {Ingroup Dynamics and Perceived Effectiveness of Partially Distributed
   Teams},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Research problem: Partially distributed teams (PDTs) are virtual teams
   that consist of at least two distinct geographically dispersed subgroups
   that communicate mainly through information and communication technology
   (ICT). As such teams become increasingly prevalent, it is important to
   understand how to manage them to maximize team effectiveness. The
   perceptions of effectiveness of PDTs may be significantly decreased when
   they are characterized by ingroup dynamics, consisting of preferential
   attitudes and actions toward collocated members, with accompanying
   conflict and lack of trust in regard to the distant subteam(s). Research
   questions: Do ingroup dynamics negatively impact perceptions of
   effectiveness in PDTs and, if so, how strongly? What factors can lessen
   ingroup dynamics-specifically, can training or reliable ICT support
   decrease ingroup dynamics? Does organizational context affect these
   relationships? Does whether or not the PDT is international affect these
   relationships? Does the number of subgroups in a PDT affect these
   relationships? Literature review: Social identity theory suggests how
   ingroup dynamics may emerge and create fault lines between subteams in a
   PDT. Effectiveness is defined in terms of process performance, which
   refers to how well the teamwork process has been undertaken. Prior
   research suggests that ICT reliability and training for work in
   distributed teams may decrease ingroup dynamics and improve
   effectiveness. International members, the specific organizational
   context, and the number of subteams per team might moderate these
   relationships. Methodology: An online survey of professionals with
   experience in PDTs was conducted, with two subsamples-one from a single
   large telecommunications company and one from a mix of organizations.
   Partial least squares regression was used to build and test a model of
   the relationships among the variables measured. Results: Ingroup
   dynamics have a strong negative relationship with perceived
   effectiveness. Overall, technology reliability and training
   significantly reduce ingroup dynamics. In the telecommunications
   company, training increased ingroup dynamics; thus, training may not
   always be beneficial, depending on organizational culture and the modes
   and types of training provided by a specific organization. Neither
   international membership on the team nor the number of subgroups per
   team was a significant multigroup moderator on any path in our model.
   Conclusions: These results help to extend social identity theory into
   this domain as they elucidate specifically that ICT reliability and
   training promote effectiveness of PDTs and that ingroup dynamics affect
   the perceptions of effectiveness in such teams. The results give
   managers guidance on what issues of PDTs to focus on to promote the
   effectiveness of PDTs.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Deciding whether to accept or reject contract clauses
   in software purchasing contracts is a complex communication-related
   task, which is likely faced daily by a multitude of software purchasing
   professionals in a variety of organizations. Research question: What are
   the effects of viewing contract clauses as video clips, compared to
   viewing clauses as text only, in terms of cognitive effort,
   communication ambiguity, and correctness in the acceptance or rejection
   of clauses in software purchasing contracts? Literature review: The
   literature on the Media Richness and Media Naturalness theories suggest
   that viewing contract clauses as video clips should reduce cognitive
   effort and communication ambiguity. However, while Media Richness theory
   suggests that correctness in the acceptance or rejection of clauses in
   software purchasing contracts should increase with the use of video
   clips, Media Naturalness theory suggests a neutral overall effect.
   Methodology: An experiment was conducted in which student participants
   were asked to either accept or reject 20 clauses from a software
   contract, placing themselves in the position of buyers. Of the 20
   clauses, 6 were intentionally deceitful and potentially harmful to the
   buyer. Approximately half of the participants reviewed the contract
   clauses as web-based text, and the remaining as web-based video clips.
   Results and conclusions: Viewing contract clauses as video clips was
   associated with significantly less cognitive effort and less
   communication ambiguity than viewing the clauses as text only.
   Counterintuitively, increases in perceived cognitive effort and
   communication ambiguity were associated with more successful
   identification and rejection of deceitful contract clauses. The
   combination of these competing effects led to an overall neutral effect
   of the medium on the correctness in the acceptance or rejection of
   clauses. These findings are consistent with expectations based on Media
   Naturalness theory, particularly its compensatory adaptation
   proposition, and inconsistent with expectations based on Media Richness
   theory.},

Title = {The Current State of Component Content Management: An Integrative
   Literature Review},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-270},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research problem: The widespread adoption of component content
   management in organizations calls for a comprehensive summary of the
   territory of this phenomenon. A summary provides stakeholders in
   component content management with a sense of how the practice has
   evolved and its implications to research, theory, and future practice.
   The last such review was published in 2003. This integrative literature
   review is intended to fill the gap in the literature by describing the
   current state of component content management as presented in the
   current publications. Research questions: How is ``content{''} currently
   defined, described, and approached in the component content-management
   literature? What processes and tools are organizations adopting to
   achieve the goals of component content management? Literature review:
   The theoretical orientation of this review is Rhetorical Genre theory,
   which allows for classifying individual components as a genre
   characterized by granularity, reusability, and potentiality. Component
   content management gained recognition in the mid-1990s when early
   adopter organizations were looking for more efficient and effective
   approaches to reusing information between similar products or versions
   of the same product. Developments in the 2000s include a surge of
   publications focused on defining and describing component content
   management; new best practices for implementing a component
   content-management initiative; evolving processes and technologies for
   creating highly engineered, modular content that can automatically
   adjust to specific user requests and device capabilities; and
   collaborative efforts to integrate content creation and management
   strategies across organizational units. Scholarly and trade publications
   increasingly explore different concerns; whereas scholarly publications
   tend to offer critical perspectives on component content management,
   trade publications tend to describe processes and technologies and
   articulate best practices. Both focus on the goals of component content
   management, such as single sourcing, content reuse, multichannel
   publishing, and the structured content components required to achieve
   these goals. Methodology: To answer the research questions, we reviewed
   the body of literature on component content management. To do so, we
   searched library databases, Google, and Amazon. com for articles and
   books in both the scholarly and trade literature; we also sought out
   publications by well-known voices in component content management who
   direct successful consultant and/ or research organizations. We then
   classified selected publications in relation to research questions and
   identified themes within each research question. The review did not
   explore other types of content management. Results and conclusions:
   Current component content-management literature suggests that component
   content management has evolved from a practice focused on single
   sourcing and reuse strategies for product documentation to a mature
   discipline concerned with designing pre-sales and post-sales information
   products for a multitude of devices and delivery channels. In recent
   years, trade publications have led the way to standardizing the
   discipline's core concepts, methodologies, processes, and technologies,
   such as structured content, structured authoring, single sourcing,
   component-based content strategy, Extensible Markup Language authoring
   tools, and component-content-management systems.
   Scholarly publications, however, have had comparatively little impact on
   advancing the discipline of component content management because only a
   handful of publications have focused on the topic and almost no
   crosstalk exists between these publications and the trade literature.
   Several questions about the practices of component content management
   still need to be answered, particularly in the areas of multilingual
   communication and content quality and usability. Based on the results of
   the literature review, we call for a coherent, robust, and ambitious
   component content-management research agenda that addresses topics such
   as content quality and usability, the diffusion of content-management
   systems, and global content management and that leads to studies that
   both advance scholarship and improve component content-management
   practice.},

Abstract = {Teaching problem: Undergraduate research at the university level often
   focuses on the production of a traditional research paper, one with an
   academic orientation, often information heavy and analysis light,
   emphasizing the importance of secondary sources and documentation style
   over the process of inquiry. What approaches to undergraduate research
   would enable aspiring technical communicators to develop research skills
   that would better prepare them for success in a professional
   environment? Situating the case: The approaches described in this paper
   draw on the work of Mel Levine as presented in, Ready or Not, Here Life
   Comes, in which he delineates several reasons why young people encounter
   problems when they enter professional environments: overly managed
   lives, no experience of delayed gratification, inability to think
   critically, limited knowledge of their own strengths and weaknesses, and
   an expectation of stability in the so-called adult world. Levine claims
   that these problems can be addressed by helping students develop a sense
   of inner direction as opposed to direction from without, an
   understanding of how to think critically and apply knowledge, a
   willingness to build and refine skills over time, and competent writing
   and speaking skills. In addition, the approaches described in this paper
   draw on three well-established research traditions: mixed methods
   research, problem-based research, and action research. How this case was
   studied: This paper describes the experiences of using two approaches to
   teach Research in Technical and Scientific Communication at a mid-sized
   state university in Virginia. The material was collected informally over
   a period of six years of teaching the course-through observation,
   student feedback, and completed research reports. About the case:
   Research in Technical and Scientific Communication required students to
   produce a research report within the context of real-world inquiry,
   appropriately focused for a specific audience and purpose, using both
   primary and secondary sources, and including analysis as well as
   information. Two approaches were used. The Real Client approach required
   students to investigate a small-scale, real-world problem or need, which
   became the focus of a research report that could be submitted to a
   specific audience for a specific purpose, both identified by the student
   early in the research process. The Impact of Technology approach
   required students to consider the impact of technology on modern life,
   investigate a narrower topic within this broad topic, and prepare a
   report that could be published in the university magazine or student
   newspaper. Examples of strong and weak research reports illustrate which
   features of each approach worked well and which posed challenges.
   Overall, students responded well to both approaches, but found the
   Impact of Technology approach more congenial because it was more
   familiar to them than the Real Client approach. Nonetheless, with both
   approaches, but especially with the Real Client approach, students
   seemed reluctant to make necessary contacts, conduct in-depth
   interviews, and include well-developed analysis. They were more
   comfortable gathering information anonymously through secondary source
   material or online surveys, and presenting that information with a
   limited amount of analysis. Both approaches served to move students
   toward a more realistic understanding of the kind of research needed in
   professional environments. Conclusions: These approaches also addressed
   the concerns raised by Levine.
   The study was limited by its informal nature, with observations and
   conclusions resulting from a six-year period of informal experimentation
   and refinement, during which the requirements for the research report
   were continually redesigned to better address what students would need
   to be successful in a workplace.},

Title = {Incorporating User Appropriation, Media Richness, and Collaborative
   Knowledge Sharing Into Blended E-Learning Training},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Problem: E-learning has become a standard in many organizations to train
   its workforce and build an information network that encourages
   collaborative knowledge sharing. As a result of technological and global
   factors, the complexity of delivering successful e-learning courses and
   products is an increasing challenge for subject matter experts and
   instructional designers. Online training courses have become blended
   learning environments, comprised of synchronous and asynchronous modes
   of delivery, multiple media forms, and global and localized audiences to
   meet the demands and flexibility it affords. Successful blended
   e-learning is more than simply mixing online and live instructional
   modes; it can also include a combination of multiple media types,
   technologies, and communication modes. E-learners have become multimodal
   learners, with the ability to adapt to multiple media forms, environment
   types, and tools. Key concepts: Understanding the complex interaction of
   technology use, collaborative knowledge sharing, and media can
   facilitate more effective communication exchanges between instructor,
   content, and learner. Some concepts that help describe the complexities
   of blended e-learning include technological appropriation, technological
   accommodation, media richness, media synchronicity and naturalness,
   blended e-learning, and collaborative knowledge sharing. Key lessons:
   Research trends suggest learners appropriate technology and media forms,
   and evaluate usefulness based on a range of factors, including richness,
   experience, perception, and recommendation. Blended learning
   environments add complexity by mixing spatial (distributed and
   colocated) and temporal (asynchronous and synchronous) components with
   increased levels of collaborative knowledge sharing. From these research
   trends, the following best practices for developing e-learning are
   recommended: (1) consider media richness factors and user preferences in
   media and tool selection; (2) encourage personalization to foster trust;
   (3) facilitate collaborative knowledge sharing both inside and outside
   the training setting; (4) balance roles as knowledge facilitator, coach,
   and information manager; and (5) invest additional time in both course
   and instructor preparation. Implications: Blended e-learning presents a
   number of challenges for subject matter experts and designers of
   instructional content. Subject matter experts must consult with
   instructional designers and consider the different media platforms,
   environments, and formats that optimize the best pairing of content with
   delivery mode and media type. Content experts and designers must
   collaborate on methods of effectively adapting course content to account
   for perceived richness, user experience, and task complexity.
   Instructors must also invest additional time in planning and accounting
   for user preferences and communication practices in online training.},

Abstract = {This paper extends the Behavioral Ecology of Consumption, a foraging
   theory model of human decision-making in an online environment, in a
   replication and extension of previous online foraging research.
   Participants shopped for music CDs in a simulated internet mall
   featuring five virtual music stores with delay to in-stock feedback of
   2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 seconds. Preference was measured as the proportion
   of total purchases and shopping time allocated to each store. Consistent
   with previous research, a hyperbolic decay function provided the best
   fit to the data. The results further the consumer foraging model and
   bolster existing evidence of the generality of hyperbolic discounting
   and matching in human decision-making.},

Abstract = {Findings from a previous study indicate that dominance was a key
   inhibitor of creativity in virtual teams. This study extends
   understanding of dominance through an in-depth, qualitative analysis of
   eight virtual teams. Two research questions are addressed: (1) how is
   dominance manifested in virtual teams? and (2) why does dominance occur
   in some teams, and not others? Findings indicate that dominance occurred
   in three different patterns. Although both mates and females dominated,
   a commonality across patterns was that the dominant individual belonged
   to the majority sex in each team. Furthermore, dominance was driven by a
   combination of a few team member status traits. When one or more status
   markers belonged to a single person-the dominant member-and were absent
   in other team members, dominance was pronounced. In teams that did not
   experience dominance, these status indicators were spread across
   multiple members. Additionally, even though all teams communicated
   strictly via asynchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC),
   equalization was not evidenced in the majority of teams. Status
   characteristics theory and proportional representation theory provide a
   basis to explain the prevalence, as well as the absence, of dominance in
   these virtual teams.},

Abstract = {Based on feedback from graduate students, from science and engineering
   faculty who teach graduate students, and from surveys about the skills
   graduate students need, the authors have designed and taught a
   graduate-Level course in academic publishing. This article describes the
   need for the course and the theory behind its design, outlines the
   course content, and presents assessment data from the first three course
   iterations. The findings indicate that this course has increased
   students' awareness of the role of rhetorical and discourse knowledge as
   well as their level of confidence in their ability to write and publish
   professional work. Further, findings from interviews with faculty
   advisors yield insight into the benefits of the course for students,
   advisors, disciplinary programs, and cross-curricular initiatives.},

Abstract = {This article presents. findings from an empirical study investigating
   the transfer of rhetorical knowledge, defined as audience awareness,
   sense of purpose, organization, use of visuals, professional appearance,
   and style, between the technical communication and the engineering
   disciplines. Various data collection methods were used to examine the
   skills and rhetorical knowledge students learned in a technical
   communication course and to determine whether or not students relied on
   that knowledge as they completed writing assignments in an engineering
   course. Also examined was the effect of workplace experiences on shaping
   students' rhetorical knowledge. This study indicated that students did
   appear to transfer rhetorical strategies between different contexts, and
   those, strategies were learned in the workplace as well as the
   classroom.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An experiment was carried out to investigate whether it is useful to add
   system information to procedural information in instructional text. It
   was assumed that readers of instructions construct both a procedural and
   a system mental model, and that the latter enables the readers to infer
   possible missing information in procedural instructions. Moreover it was
   assumed that system information would increase the cognitive load during
   reading and practicing, and that it would affect the appreciation of the
   instructions as well as the self-efficacy of the reader The participants
   in the experiment read instructions and practiced with a fictitious
   machine before performing a number of tasks and answering a
   questionnaire. The results indicate that system information increased
   the cognitive load during reading and decreased self-efficacy, while the
   instructional text with system information was judged as more difficult.
   The effect on performance is limited: system information leads to faster
   performance for correctly completed tasks.},

Abstract = {Thinking-aloud protocols may be the most widely used method in usability
   testing, but the descriptions of this practice in the usability
   literature and the work habits of practitioners do not conform to the
   theoretical basis most often cited for it: Ericsson and Simon's seminal
   work PROTOCOL ANALYSIS: VERBAL REPORTS AS DATA {[}1]. After reviewing
   Ericsson and Simon's theoretical basis for thinking aloud, we review the
   ways in which actual usability practice diverges from this model We then
   explore the concept of SPEECH GENRE as an alternative theoretical
   framework. We first consider uses of this new framework that are
   consistent with Simon and Ericsson's goal of eliciting a verbal report
   that is as undirected undisturbed, and constant as possible. We then go
   on to consider how the proposed new approach might handle problems that
   arise in usability testing that appear to require interventions not
   supported in the older model.},

Title = {Technical Communicators' Use of and Requirements for Special Language
   Reference Tools},

Abstract = {Background: Technical communicators use special language information to
   describe technology products. Researching such information is part and
   parcel of their job and thus occupies a relevant share of their working
   time. Literature review: Numerous studies examine information needs and
   search techniques of various professionals, such as engineers or
   translators. However, very little is known about technical
   communicators' use of and requirements for information sources
   containing special language information. This article contributes to
   filling this research gap by discussing results of an empirical study.
   Research questions: 1. What types of nonhuman information sources do
   technical communicators use when researching special language
   information? 2. What properties do technical communicators expect from
   special language reference tools? Research methodology: We conducted a
   written online survey among technical communicators. In this article, we
   analyze and interpret survey data related to the two research questions.
   Results: Respondents use 14 major types of information sources for
   researching special language information. Half can be categorized as
   reference tools, while the other half are document-like. Respondents
   would like to have special language reference tools that are available
   electronically, can be adapted to their personal needs, and offer
   up-to-date information with good usability. Conclusions: Half of the
   information source types are document-like and can be used as text
   corpora. Thus, text corpus-management methods and tools should be
   promoted in technical communication practice and teaching. Technical
   communicators' requirements and wishes described in this article lay the
   groundwork for developing tailor-made special language reference tools.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Community engagement offers one pathway for technical and
   professional communication (TPC) to enact social justice; however, the
   community impact of partnerships has often been neglected in favor of
   more prevalent research on student benefits. This case study examines a
   community partnership that has emphasized community impact toward
   distributive justice, sharing its approach to equitable collaboration.
   About the case: The partnership under study was formed between a
   university grant writing program and a small nonprofit serving the
   surviving loved ones of homicide victims. Collaboration within the
   partnership takes many forms, including service-learning courses in
   grant writing and content strategy, student internships, and counsel
   through the organization's board of directors. Situating the case:
   Research on community engagement has demonstrated its impact on student
   growth, but community outcomes have not been as robustly investigated or
   prioritized in partnerships. This case adds to the literature by
   discussing the collaboration tactics used in a community partnership to
   achieve community results. Methods: The study uses quantitative outcomes
   and qualitative feedback from community partners to assess community
   impact. Partners' insights about collaboration are put into context with
   student and faculty processes used in the partnership. Results: Analysis
   suggests that the partnership has had a meaningful impact on the
   nonprofit's work in the community, in the form of material resources and
   sustainable infrastructure. Organization staff identify collaboration
   tactics that prioritize equity: balancing perspectives, aligning goals,
   and ``showing up.{''} Conclusion: Further research is needed to broaden
   the understanding of the connections between collaborative tactics and
   community impact.},

Title = {Diversity and Communication in Virtual Project Teams},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Virtual teams, especially project teams, increasingly rely
   on computer-mediated communication for interaction when collaborating
   and completing their tasks. Team members represent various cultures,
   occupations, and industries. Virtual teams often use English as a
   business lingua franca in communication. This study investigates
   critical factors related to virtual project teams that influence
   computer-mediated communication. Research questions: 1. How is diversity
   in video meetings experienced by the members of multidisciplinary and
   multicultural project teams? 2. Do differences in team members'
   occupational or industrial backgrounds show in their opinions on video
   meetings? Literature review: The effectiveness of communication has been
   identified as playing a critical role in the success of virtual
   projects. Diversity, whether disciplinary or cultural, enriches teamwork
   by bringing different viewpoints to discussions. On the other hand,
   diversity can also set some challenges for communicating these
   viewpoints. Research methodology: Mixed methods were used to analyze
   data obtained from 104 responses to an online survey. Spearman's
   correlation coefficient and Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric tests were
   used for statistical analysis, and open comments were analyzed using
   thematic content analysis. Results and conclusion: The findings show
   that linguistic, cultural, and occupational diversity facilitates
   communication in virtual project team meetings. In addition, applying
   appropriate features of video meeting tools in different stages of
   project teamwork leads to better communication in virtual teams. A high
   level of English proficiency is not required, but clear communication
   rules are essential. In addition, some occupational or industry-specific
   differences in opinions on communication could be identified.},

Title = {The Linkage Between Communication Satisfaction, Human Resources
   Management Practices, Person-Organization Fit, and Commitment: Evidence
   From Malaysia},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: This article explores the previously undiscovered
   relationship between communication satisfaction (CS), human resources
   management (HRM) practices, person-organization fit (P-O fit), and
   affective commitment (AC) among full-time Malaysian employees in the
   service industry. Literature review: Despite the recent proliferation of
   papers dealing with communication satisfaction, little work investigates
   the role of HRM practices and P-O fit as mediators of the relationship
   between communication satisfaction and AC. Research question: Do HRM
   practices and P-O fit act as mediators of the relationship between
   communication satisfaction and AC? Research methodology: A structural
   equation model using partial least squares is employed to study the
   impact of HRM practices and P-O fit on the linkage between communication
   satisfaction and AC among 195 full-time employees from various
   organizations in the service sector in Malaysia. Results: The results
   suggest that high communication satisfaction leads to positive
   perceptions of HRM practices, which, in turn, lead to favorable
   perceptions of P-O fit and then ultimately to high AC. Conclusions: This
   study provides useful insights for human resource managers in addressing
   the linkage between communication satisfaction, HRM practices, P-O fit,
   and AC. If HRM policies are communicated positively, employees will
   perceive them to be fair, and that perception leads to a perception of
   P-O fit. HRM policies can also improve P-O fit if employees undergo
   training to align their values with the values of their organization.
   These perceptions lead to higher AC, thus contributing to the overall
   positive working atmosphere in the service industry.},

Abstract = {Background: Qualitative technical communication research often produces
   datasets that are too large to manage effectively with hand-coded
   approaches. Text-mining methods, used carefully, may uncover patterns
   and provide results for larger datasets that are more easily reproduced
   and scaled. Research questions: 1. To what degree can hand collection
   results be replicated by automated data collection? 2. To what degree
   can hand-coded results be replicated by machine coding? 3. What are the
   affordances and limitations of each method? Literature review: We
   introduce the stages of data collection and analysis that researchers
   typically discuss in the literature, and show how researchers in
   technical communication and other fields have discussed the affordances
   and limitations of hand collection and coding versus automated methods
   throughout each stage. Research methodology: We utilize an existing
   dataset that was hand-collected and hand-coded. We discuss the
   collection and coding processes, and demonstrate how they might be
   replicated with web scraping and machine coding. Results/discussion: We
   found that web scraping demonstrated an obvious advantage of automated
   data collection: speed. Machine coding was able to provide comparable
   outputs to hand coding for certain types of data; for more nuanced and
   verbally complex data, machine coding was less useful and less reliable.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of considering the
   context of a particular project when weighing the affordances and
   limitations of hand collecting and coding over automated approaches.
   Ultimately, a mixed-methods approach that relies on a combination of
   hand coding and automated coding should prove to be the most productive
   for current and future kinds of technical communication work, in which
   close attention to the nuances of language is critical, but in which
   processing large amounts of data would yield significant benefits as
   well.},

Abstract = {Background: This document describes the implementation of an automated
   document-generation process for the creation of software-quality reports
   compliant with the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS)
   standards. Research statement: We propose a solution for the generation
   of technical documents that collect and aggregate data from different
   sources. In addition, we analyze the feasibility of building a solution
   that supports engineers in the generation of these complex artifacts.
   Situating the case: The structure and content of Software Product
   Assurance Milestone Reports and Software Verification Reports are
   defined in ECSS-Q-ST-80C and ECSS-M-ST-40C. Companies developing
   software for the European Space Agency must prepare these reports to
   detail development activities and the subsequent quality of software
   products. These reports incorporate data generated from different
   activities and managed with different software engineering tools. Case
   study: The automation techniques described in this paper were designed
   to create complex documents (quality and verification reports) based on
   the use of XML for data exchange and integration, and a set of
   connectors to collect software engineering data generated using
   different applications for requirements management, architectural
   design, testing, etc. Conclusions: The feasibility of the proposed
   solution was validated by applying it to two projects in the aerospace
   industry. The conclusion demonstrates that the automatic generation of
   complex documents from multiple sources of data is economically feasible
   and may produce benefits, including time to delivery and a significant
   reduction of production costs, by using existing XML-related
   technologies.},

Title = {Technical Communicators as Agents and Adopters of Change: A Case Study
   of the Implementation of an Early Content-Management System},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-288},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: This case study examines the implementation of an early
   single-source (the reuse across documents and projects of content stored
   in a database) content-management system among technical communicators
   and how they influenced the decision to adopt the technology. Research
   questions: (1) Why was a component content-management system developed
   and what was the process of its implementation? (2) How did technical
   communicators, functioning as both adopters and change agents, influence
   the new system's adoption? What affected their perceptions of agency
   during the implementation? Situating the case: Diffusion of Innovations
   Theory defines innovation adoption as a communication process that
   occurs over time. When participating as change agents in innovation
   diffusion, technical communicators are uniquely qualified to support
   technological change because they are skilled in making technologies
   accessible to users. Technical communicators can also be the recipients
   of change, particularly when organizations adopt new technologies, such
   as content-management systems. Given their expertise at the interface of
   technology and its users, technical communicators are well positioned to
   impact the adoption of content-management systems. Methodology: A
   single, retrospective instrumental case design examined the early 2000s'
   implementation of a single-source content-management system in the
   technical communication group of a global company. Surveys, interviews,
   and document analysis were used to examine the case over a six-year
   period About the case: A single-source system was adopted to contain
   costly increases in document cycle time resulting from: (1) customized
   production of complex and varied products and (2) new European Union
   regulations requiring all product documentation written in the national
   language at the point of sale. The system stored product information in
   a central repository as numbered modules that could be reused in future
   deliverables. Doing so brought greater continuity to authoring,
   translation, and publication of content. The system eliminated
   retranslation of information and automatically recorded and applied any
   subsequent changes to all affected documents. Technical communicators
   functioned as change agents and adopters during the system's
   implementation. Technical communicators in the organization had the
   choice to adopt the system, and adoption rates varied among staff
   members. Despite preparation for possible resistance, several staff
   initially rejected the new system. Those who adopted it did so quickly
   and created a shared meaning about the system with change agents, a
   meaning not shared with resistors. The decision of whether to adopt was
   influenced by perceptions of the innovation and of agency (positive and
   negative) about the change agents. Conclusions: A pro-innovation bias
   can impede the creation of shared meaning between change agents and
   adopters. Emphasizing technical knowledge about the innovation over
   persuasive elements of empathy for the uncertainty it produces and
   identity of what it means to be a writer can also stifle adoption. As
   change agents, technical communicators influence adoption through their
   rhetorical understanding of situation and capacity for establishing
   contexts that allow for the construction of shared meaning between
   change agents and potential adopters. Also, a perceived lack of decisive
   leadership or a champion for the change risks restricting the power of
   change agents to influence adoption and can create a space for
   protracted resistance to it.},

Title = {A Study of the Usefulness of Deploying a Questionnaire to Identify
   Cultural Dynamics Potentially Affecting a Content-Management Project},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {289-308},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: A content-management project that proceeds with an
   incomplete understanding of the views, reservations, agendas, and
   attitudes held by stakeholders could likely encounter problems in
   implementation. The vast majority of content-management implementation
   projects proceed with very little visibility into the cultural dynamics
   that will eventually play such a central role in determining the success
   or failure of the projects. This case study examines the usefulness of
   deploying a needs assessment questionnaire to gather qualitative data
   that could help content-management project leaders understand
   participant needs, attitudes, and perceptions, and that could
   potentially improve the implementation of content-management projects.
   Research questions: How might previously published research questions
   for assessing cultural dynamics be adapted for a questionnaire intended
   to gather input from participants in the early stages of the
   implementation of two separate content-management projects? What kinds
   of issues does the questionnaire elicit from participants? To what
   extent is the questionnaire useful in assessing content-management
   project participant needs and how might it be revised and adapted for
   other organizational contexts? Situating the case: Implementing a
   content-management project results in a change to organizational
   processes; careful attention to managing this change is essential to the
   success of the project. Specific change-management issues emphasized in
   literature that addresses organizational and technological change
   include organizational readiness, stakeholder input, communication of
   project goals and plans with stakeholders, and training and time to
   learn and practice new approaches to operations. Organizational
   culture-a set of beliefs and values that members of an company share in
   common-plays a role in implementations of technology. Assessing
   organizational climate and stakeholder values and
   attitudes-characteristics of organizational culture-as part of a
   change-management plan can ensure that the culture is addressed when
   implementing a content-management project. Methodology: This project
   consisted of three parts: designing a pilot questionnaire based on a
   previous published methodology for assessing cultural dynamics,
   conducting the questionnaire within two organizations implementing
   content-management systems, and assessing the extent to which the
   questionnaire was useful in the context of the content-management
   projects. Responses were analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach.
   About the case: We developed a cultural dynamics needs assessment
   questionnaire and deployed it within two organizations with the purpose
   of gathering data about the attitudes and perceptions of project
   participants toward the impending content-management system
   implementation. The questionnaires informed the implementations of
   content management as anticipated. Conclusions: A questionnaire can help
   understand the cultural dynamics impacting the adoption of new
   technologies and processes; this method can be included as part of an
   overall needs assessment for a content-management project. This study
   also confirms the merit of the research methodology followed; the
   questionnaire design elicited thoughtful responses from participants and
   the analysis approach illuminated insights that were then used to engage
   participants and modify project implementation plans. The constructive
   outcome of this study suggests the need for more empirical studies and
   field evaluation studies that build on this one.},

Title = {Functional and Nonfunctional Quality in Cloud-Based Collaborative
   Writing: An Empirical Investigation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {182-203},

Abstract = {Research problem: Collaborative writing has dramatically changed with
   the use of cloud-based tools, such as Google Docs. System quality-both
   functional (i.e., what services the system provides) and nonfunctional
   quality (i.e., how well the system provides the services)-influences
   user satisfaction with these tools. Research question: Do functional and
   nonfunctional quality influence user satisfaction in cloud-based systems
   that support collaborative writing? Literature review: The intersection
   of literature from collaborative writing and system quality presents the
   theoretical foundation for this study. The literature on collaborative
   writing suggests that technology facilitates and constrains
   collaborative writing, while the literature on cloud computing
   highlights the challenges in ensuring various aspects of quality.
   Furthermore, literature on system quality emphasizes the importance of
   the different facets of quality (i.e., functional and nonfunctional) and
   their impacts on user satisfaction. Methodology: We conducted a survey
   of 150 undergraduate students enrolled in an information systems course
   at a large urban university. Results: The results show that functional
   and nonfunctional quality play a critical role in shaping user
   satisfaction with cloud computing and that nonfunctional quality has a
   stronger impact than functional quality. Implications: To ensure
   satisfaction with cloud computing, organizations need to provide
   adequate development and maintenance resources to ensure both types of
   quality, and they need to recognize that nonfunctional quality plays a
   key role in shaping user satisfaction with cloud computing.},

Title = {The Frequency and Function of <i>Just</i> in British and New Zealand
   Engineering Lectures},

Abstract = {Research problem: This corpus comparison study examines the occurrences
   of just as used in British and New Zealand engineering lectures in order
   to discover its frequency and functions and to consider its role in
   professional communication. Research questions: Is just as frequent in
   the academic genre of university lectures as in other genres of spoken
   English? (1) Does just have the same functions in British and New
   Zealand engineering lectures as found in a previous study at an American
   university? (2) Does a better understanding of the different ways that
   just is used in lectures have pedagogical implications for professional
   communication, especially for English as an additional language
   learners? Literature review: Previous studies show just mainly functions
   as a `{''}minimizer'{''} (merely, only, simply) in university lectures
   in America, and functions the same in British and New Zealand university
   lectures on engineering. Just also functions as part of a metadiscursive
   frame (let me just explain), and stance (the speaker's attitude toward
   the content communicated: don't just copy down what I've done). In
   response, English as an additional language learners can learn to
   recognize and distinguish the different functions of just and use them
   appropriately. Methodology: The researcher used a corpus linguistics
   methodology to determine the frequency of just and a discourse analysis
   method to see if the functions of just identified in a previous study of
   the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English applied to the corpus of
   British and New Zealand engineering lectures. These lectures are all
   part of the Engineering Lecture Corpus, which was started at Coventry
   University and includes AUT University in New Zealand. Results and
   discussion: The frequency of just in British and New Zealand engineering
   lectures was high: it occurred in the top 50 words in the wordlists of
   both sets of lectures. Just was used in British and New Zealand
   engineering lectures the same way as in the American university,
   functioning mostly as a ``minimizer,{''} often to reduce the imposition
   of what was being said or asked. It occurred much more frequently in the
   British engineering lectures than the New Zealand ones, often in short
   stretches of discourse. Its ``locative{''} meaning, used when indicating
   a precise location, occurred more often in the New Zealand Electrical
   Engineering lectures and in the British Civil Engineering lectures. A
   study of the different ways that just functions, and the frequency with
   which it is used in spoken academic English should lead to a better
   understanding of its function in professional communication. The
   limitation of the study was the sample size, and the fact that it was an
   opportunistic sample taken from a limited number of lecturers in a
   limited number of universities. While adopting the functions used in the
   American study was a limitation, the additional category of just used in
   multiword units was uncovered. Limitations of the unavailablilty of
   recordings to determine pronunciation differences was also noted, with
   examples provided to show possible misunderstandings. Future research
   would examine an expanded data sample, providing better representation
   of the language of lectures in the UK and New Zealand within and outside
   the subdisciplines of engineering, and investigating the ways that the
   pronunciation of just affects its meaning.
   Other spoken academic and general corpora, such as the British Academic
   Spoken English corpus and the spoken components of the British National
   Corpus and the Corpus of Contemporary American English could be studied
   for comparison purposes of the frequency and functions of just.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present, from an academic perspective, the perceived
   quality ratings of business and technical communication journals.
   Through a survey of academic experts, we asked respondents to rate the
   top overall journals, business communication journals, technical
   communication journals, and the top journals from a technology
   perspective. In addition, we asked respondents to list the journals that
   they read most frequently. We analyzed the results by breaking down the
   rankings into world regions and academic departments. The top-three
   overall journals for all regions are Journal of Business and Technical
   Communication, Journal of Business Communication, and IEEE TRANSACTIONS
   ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. Importantly, differences by world region
   and academic department type were found in all these rankings. These
   results can support researchers worldwide by helping them tartlet their
   publishing efforts to journals that have the best fit with their
   business and technical communication discipline, world region, and
   academic home.},

Abstract = {Almost all IT, engineering research, financial analysis, and
   manufacturing industries are confronted with a question: to outsource or
   not? The outsourcing and offshoring trend is inspired by success stories
   of huge cost savings, decreased time-to-market, and better quality.
   Simultaneously, outsourcing-gone-bad stories highlight how hidden costs
   exceed benefits, cross-cultural problems impact quality, and
   intellectual property risks shadow project lifecycles. Managers in
   companies are presented with a confusing picture for which there are no
   easy answers. Companies, vendors, and policymakers need a framework to
   understand the outsourcing phenomenon and plan implementation strategies
   for outsourced projects. At present, many companies go with the gut
   based on the experience of others and media reports. But very rarely are
   two technical documentation tasks alike and never are the concerns of
   two technical communication tasks the same. This tutorial presents the
   Twelve Driver Framework and the Driver-Model Percentage Matrix to assess
   the benefits and risks of outsourcing a technical communication task. In
   the end, qualitative decision-making will determine an organization's
   decision about outsourcing,, but the use of such aframework and related
   metrics will greatly enhance the quality of thefinal choice.},

Abstract = {When document designers in English speaking countries localize documents
   for readers in other cultures, they should consider what text
   organization will best suit those readers. The study presented here
   examines the effect of inductive versus deductive organizational
   patterns on Japanese readers so as to identify what pattern may best
   suit them. The study assessed Japanese readers' comprehension of and
   preference for expository text that contains a thesis and is organized
   either inductively or deductively. The results reveal that readers
   recall more information from inductively organized text, Preference
   results were less clear. The implications for native English speaking
   document designers are discussed at length.},

Title = {Comparing Student Learning in Face-to-Face Versus Online Sections of an
   Information Technology Course},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},

Pages = {48-58},

Abstract = {Background: The recent COVID-19 pandemic forced most universities into
   online course delivery. As such, the rapid expansion of online learning
   and the prospect of its permanent increase for many institutions have
   sharpened the issue of the efficacy of remotely delivered courses.
   Literature review: Past studies have compared face-to-face (FTF) courses
   with online courses, with mixed results. However, the broad
   understanding is that efficacy differs based on the subject area.
   Educators frequently view theory-based courses as being better suited to
   online teaching than hands-on or experiential courses. Research
   question: Can information technology courses-especially those that are
   more experiential and technical-be supported through online learning
   given the extent of differences in efficacy between online and
   face-to-face experiential, technical courses? Research methodology: We
   compared multiple sections of an experiential IT Outsourcing class over
   several quarters in two course delivery modes. The two modes were FTF
   delivery and online synchronous delivery. Students in each course
   section responded to two surveys where they rated their knowledge of
   different topics at the start and end of the course. Results: Online
   students reported greater increases in learning on average across all
   measured items. Self-reported knowledge gains were significantly greater
   in five items, mostly in soft skills and project management knowledge.
   The only significantly improved technical IT skill was in using software
   for virtual meetings. Conclusions and implications for education: We
   conclude that universities should embrace teaching experiential IT-based
   courses virtually, as it is possible to obtain greater improvements in
   self-efficacy, counter to much existing research. This is especially the
   case as instructional technology improves.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Computer programming faces persistent problems of inequity.
   In response, bootcamps and workshops have rapidly responded by offering
   an introduction to coding literacy intended to increase access and
   representation in the tech industry.Literature review: Prior research on
   software development focuses primarily on workplace contexts. This study
   considers bootcamps and workshops outside the workplace for minoritized
   and marginalized software developers to better understand the
   institutional contexts in which programming is taught and made. In so
   doing, it contributes to ongoing conversations on strategies for social
   justice in technical communication.Research questions: 1. How do
   bootcamps and workshops function as sites of coding education? 2. What
   strategies do activist programmers use in bootcamps and workshops to
   work towards social justice goals? Methodology: For this research, I
   interviewed organizers, instructors, and participants at three coding
   workshops and bootcamps for marginalized communities. I also conducted
   participant observation of the workshops, collected educational
   materials, and analyzed the interview transcripts using a grounded
   theory approach. Results and discussion: This analysis revealed how
   coding workshops and bootcamps operate as literacy sponsors,
   contributing to a transformative access for participants. More
   specifically, my research describes how activist programmers craft open,
   inclusive, and culturally aware pedagogies by attending to access,
   representation, community, and active learning, ultimately facilitating
   an affective coding literacy.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Despite the abundance of research into usability and
   user experience (UX), there is still debate about the relationship
   between both concepts. The user perspective is underrepresented in all
   discussions. This study examines the personal conceptions that users of
   electronic and software products have of usability and UX. Research
   questions: 1. How do users of electronic and software products
   conceptualize usability and UX? 2. What do they think is the
   relationship between both concepts? Literature review: We review the
   literature on conceptualizations of usability and UX and their
   relationship. The literature suggests that both concepts are still
   developing and that there are different views about their relationship.
   A personal-constructs research approach appears to be a fruitful way of
   shedding more light on this. Methodology: Twenty-one participants were
   asked to place up to eight products in a grid with two axes: usability
   (high-low) and UX (high-low). They then filled out a short questionnaire
   about the products. Finally, interviews were held about their decisions
   and their views on usability and UX. Results and conclusions: A weak
   positive correlation between products' usability and UX scores indicates
   that the relationship between both concepts is far from straightforward.
   An analysis of the four quadrants of the grid provides a first typology
   of products based on how users perceive their usability and UX. When
   reflecting on the relationship between the two concepts, most
   participants see usability as a part of or contributing to UX. Based on
   our findings, however, it seems risky to assume that usability is
   sufficiently covered by the overall concept of UX.},

Title = {How Do Employees in Different Job Roles in the Insurance Industry Use
   Mobile Technology Differently at Work?},

Abstract = {Background: In Taiwan, the insurance industry has the highest
   willingness and the largest budgets to implement mobile technology.
   Companies must continuously monitor, evaluate, and redesign the mobile
   IT infrastructure during implementation because when employees gain more
   experience with using mobile IT to support work tasks, they present
   their preferences and progressive needs. Therefore, exploration of how
   mobile technology can support the diverse job roles and task
   characteristics in insurance companies that have implemented mobile IT
   is vital to improving the efficiency of mobile IT implementation and
   organizational capacity. Research questions: In insurance companies: 1.
   How are different mobile devices used differently by salespeople and
   office staff? 2. What are the differences in the attitudes of
   salespeople and office staff toward using mobile technology? Literature
   review: Previous studies that explored employees' usage of mobile
   technology suggested that those in different job roles have different
   mobile technology needs and usage behaviors. These studies support
   further comparison and investigation of the mobile technology
   requirements of salespeople and office staff in insurance companies.
   Methodology: A survey collected empirical data from 177 employees from
   insurance companies in Taiwan. The participants' demographic
   information, attitudes toward applications, perceived advantages, and
   willingness to use mobile technology were collected and analyzed.
   Results and conclusions: The results showed that the most important
   tasks supported by mobile technology were instant communication and
   information access; developing an organizational culture that supports
   using mobile technology in job-related tasks can increase employees'
   adoption of mobile devices; and smartphones are thought to have better
   mobility and more functions to support main job tasks than tablets.
   Based on the findings, this study proposes suggestions for practice and
   implications for future research.},

Title = {The Social Justice Impact of Plain Language: A Critical Approach to

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Introduction: This study investigates how plain language, examined from
   a social justice perspective, is implemented in mortgage documents and
   what the implications are for African-American homebuyers. About the
   case: We argue that plain language has the potential to engage issues of
   human dignity and human rights because language accessibility in
   documents plays a large role in how citizens engage in civic and social
   activities. In regard to the home ownership process, in which
   African-American homebuyers are more likely to experience
   discrimination, we need a study of the implementation of plain language
   in documents that might contribute to communication breakdowns between
   the banking industry and this historically marginalized group. Situating
   the case: We examine plain language from a social-justice stance by
   turning a more critical eye toward how and why plain-language guidelines
   are implemented. Methods/approach: Our study focused on the initial
   disclosure statements for adjustable-rate mortgages. We paired critical
   discourse analysis with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Plain
   English Handbook guidelines for disclosure statements to analyze three
   disclosure statements. Results/discussion: We found that, generally
   speaking, each of the three disclosure statements effectively adhered to
   plain-language recommendations. However, the idea that plain language
   increases accessibility, reader comprehension, and usability is
   complicated, and the accessibility and usability of each document
   varied. Conclusions: We advocate for a human-centered approach that
   explores ways that plain-language guidelines can be applied along with a
   critical focus on amplifying agency and reducing inequity.},

Abstract = {Chinese people have actively engaged in transnational and cross-cultural
   business activities in recent decades. Some Chinese people have moved
   their business activities to overseas countries, in particular, to
   developed countries. Some of them have migrated and settled down in a
   host space. About the case: This study aims to examine the identity
   work-in particular, the construction of a hybrid identity-and the
   business communication of a Chinese-Australian migrant, Jack, from the
   perspective of Chinese researchers. Situating the case: The
   communication characteristics of Chinese people are reviewed, and some
   factors related to identity work are examined. These interrelated
   strands provide a foundation for analyzing Jack's business communication
   and identity work in a host context. Research questions: (1) As an
   immigrant, how has Jack managed his identities in his business
   communication with self and Others during his life experience of more
   than 20 years in Australia? (2) Has Jack achieved a hybrid identity that
   enables him to switch his identities as he confronts the communication
   challenges of business situations? (3) What forces affect Jack's
   everyday business communication and identity work as a
   Chinese-Australian migrant in Australia? Methodology: Theories are
   applied to analyze anecdotes relating to the business communication and
   identity work of the migrant chosen for this case study. The first
   author is positioned as a cultural insider and ethnographer, observing,
   experiencing, and reflecting on some episodes in Jack's everyday
   business communication and identity work. The second author's informed
   input as an outsider to the case study provides interpretation of data
   and adds balance and a measure of objectivity. Results: Jack's
   communication with self and cultural Others is presented and analyzed to
   examine his complicated identity work in a host business arena. His
   shifting hybrid identity helps him to cross the border of his host
   culture and obtain privileges in business competition. These stories
   reveal that Jack's identity is continually changed and reconstructed as
   he builds social and cultural capital in his new business arena.
   Conclusions: This study captures characteristics of the transnational
   and cross-cultural business communication practices of Chinese migrants
   from the inside looking out, and it suggests that identity work is an
   ongoing and complex project, and that stereotypes should be avoided in
   transnational and cross-cultural business communication practices.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The enhancement of communication skills among
   engineering students has been a focus within the engineering curriculum
   for many years. Despite this emphasis, continual published reports
   document that engineering graduates are not well versed in the areas of
   written and oral communication when they graduate and transition into
   industrial-based positions. This study focuses on examining whether
   game-based pedagogy could serve as a potential tool for enhancing the
   written and oral communication skills of engineering undergraduates.
   Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between communication
   game exposure and oral and written communication skills achievement in
   engineering students? (2) Do engineering students' perceptions of their
   oral and written communication skills development associated with
   participation in communication games align with their achievement in
   these areas? Literature review: This study examines the ability of games
   to enhance engineering student communication skills by using the lens of
   activity theory. This communication theory was chosen because it
   describes how the creation of a piece of communication goes beyond
   traditional features such as grammar and syntax to include grappling
   with the objective or goal of the work, the system within which the
   product must be completed, and the methods selected to subdivide the
   work. These same constraints were imposed on the students within this
   study, in which they were assigned a technical design report and
   infomercial (or elevator pitch) to assess their oral and written
   communication skills. Methodology: Three groups of a sophomore-level
   Introduction to Chemical Product Design course compared non-games,
   games, and games-plus instructional methods. Student design reports and
   infomercials were scored by two analysts using reliable and validated
   rubrics. Team-based performance scores for each of the three sections
   were compared to determine whether any resulting differences in
   communication achievement were associated with the incorporation of
   game-based activities within the classroom. Students' perceptions of
   their communication skill development were measured through survey
   instruments and focus groups. The focus group data were content-analyzed
   by the same two analysts using a coding scheme developed from an
   emergent qualitative analysis of the focus group data. Results and
   conclusion: We found that the use of game-based pedagogy within
   engineering classes can enhance oral and written communication skills
   even though this method of instruction is not always perceived by
   students as relevant to their achievement in these areas.},

Abstract = {Background: Despite efforts to include communication instruction in both
   college and continuing education curricula for students in all areas of
   study, workplace surveys continually report that employees'
   communication skills are lacking. The differing contexts of school and
   the workplace may be one reason for this disconnect, so teaching
   strategies that can effectively bridge this gap are needed. Research
   questions: How do students respond to using scenes from a television
   series to teach professional communication concepts within workplace
   contexts? What are advantages and drawbacks to this strategy? Situating
   the case: Strategies used to teach professional communication in a way
   that facilitates its application in the workplace include classroom
   exercises, service-learning projects involving real clients, and
   simulations. In addition, videos are a commonly used method of classroom
   teaching. They can activate verbal/linguistic, visual/spatial, and
   musical/rhythmic intelligences, allowing students to use their stronger
   intelligences and develop their weaker ones. Research also suggests that
   students appreciate visual stimulation and technology use when learning
   communication skills. How the case was studied: Students completed a
   brief end-of-course survey to gather both qualitative and quantitative
   data concerning their learning experiences with the activities
   described. About the case: To make undergraduate writing courses more
   relevant to the workplace, specific scenes from The Office were
   integrated to teach units on negative messages and intercultural issues.
   Following these clips, students completed both in-class exercises and
   course assignments pertaining to the topics covered. Results: After
   completing the class sessions and associated exercises described here,
   most students could discern the relevant concepts from the clips; they
   found both the clips and the associated exercises helpful in learning
   the concepts; and they recommended ongoing use in future classes.
   Students appreciated the comedic nature of the material, the use of
   different media, and the pop culture reference. Drawbacks included
   scenes focusing on what not to do, that often showed communication gone
   awry rather than the correct way to communicate. Some students also
   prefer more traditional teaching methods. Conclusions: The results
   indicate that the use of television clips along with associated
   exercises can be useful aids in teaching professional communication
   concepts.},

Title = {Planning for the Shaping Force of Cultural Dynamics in a Component
   Content-Management System Implementation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {216-234},

Abstract = {Problem: This tutorial explains how technical communication
   organizations can improve their chances for a successful component
   content-management system (CCMS) implementation if they plan for the
   shaping force of cultural dynamics in the technology diffusion process.
   Many component content -management (CCM) thought leaders have identified
   people factors as a major barrier to successful CCMS implementation.
   They recognize the necessity of gaining buy-in from all stakeholders and
   persuading CCMS users to change their habits of practice, follow new
   processes, and learn new authoring tools and methodologies. This
   tutorial complements existing discussions of people factors by offering
   a more complex understanding of what these factors really mean and how
   to negotiate them. Key concepts: This understanding is articulated
   through three situated views of CCMSs and their diffusion in
   organizations: (1) CCMSs are social constructs; (2) CCMS diffusion is a
   multistage, perception-driven communication process; and (3) CCMS
   diffusion is mediated by different components of organizational culture.
   These situated views highlight the shaping force of cultural dynamics in
   CCMS diffusion projects, and they speak to some of the reasons why
   common information transfer approaches to diffusion do not work. Key
   lessons: Given these views, CCM initiative leaders should consider the
   following recommendations for carrying out a CCMS diffusion project: (1)
   assess cultural dynamics in the organization and (2) implement diffusion
   enablers to facilitate shared understanding and learning and to guide
   actions toward common goals. Key lessons offer a comprehensive set of
   sample research questions that can be used to assess cultural dynamics
   as well as three kinds of diffusion enablers that can be implemented:
   interactive communication channels, training programs, and
   collaboratively developed guides. Implications: CCM initiative leaders
   who understand and plan for the shaping force of cultural dynamics in
   the CCMS diffusion process and who follow best practices for
   transitioning to CCM will improve their chances for a successful CCMS
   implementation. Leaders are encouraged to use the research questions and
   diffusion enablers are articulated here as a starting point for
   negotiating people factors that can impede diffusion.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Due to globalization and the increased availability of
   online collaboration tools, individuals are now likely to work together
   in settings where computers are their primary mode of communication.
   However, because communication characteristics are different in virtual
   team settings, especially when they are text based, communication
   problems, such as deception, arise. Recent research found that deceptive
   individuals in virtual teams can have a negative impact on group task
   performance, and it recognized that in addition to the communication
   medium, task and group characteristics, such as task complexity and
   group member experience, are important influences in these settings.
   However, the impacts of these additional influences have not been
   empirically examined. Research question: Does group members' experience
   with each other and task complexity affect their deception detection
   accuracy and task performance in a computer-mediated communication
   setting? Literature review: Previous literature has shown that deceivers
   are an important influence on computer-mediated groups. However, few
   studies have compared different group settings, and no studies have
   empirically tested the impact that task and group characteristics, such
   as task complexity and group member experience, have on these types of
   groups. Methodology: An experiment was designed to test the effect of
   group member experience and task complexity on computer-mediated groups
   facing deception. Two-hundred fifty-six undergraduates (256) were
   selected for the experiment. Results and conclusions: Quantitative
   analysis, which included multivariate analysis of variance, revealed
   that (a) groups performing a low-complexity task were better at
   detecting deception than were groups performing a high-complexity task,
   (b) groups with members who had experience with each other had higher
   task performance than did inexperienced groups, and (c) experienced
   groups did not have higher accuracy in detecting deception than did
   inexperienced groups. These results highlight the importance of
   understanding the different affects that task complexity and group
   member experience have on virtual teams facing deception, and they
   provide insight into what practices can help minimize the impact of
   interactive computer-mediated deception.},

Abstract = {We present a user-centered database query language called QBT (Query By
   Templates) for user communication with databases containing complex
   structured data, such as data stored in the Extensible Markup Language
   (XML). XML has revolutionized data storage as well as representation and
   transfer. methods in today's internet applications. The growing
   popularity of XML as a language for the representation of data has
   enabled its use for several applications involving storage, interchange,
   and retrieval of data. Several textual query languages have been
   proposed for XML retrieval, including the World Wide Web Consortium's
   (W3C) recommendation of XQuery. Native XML database systems. have been
   implemented, all of which provide methods for user communication with
   the database, although most communication methods use text-based query
   languages or form-based interfaces. QBT the language presented here, is
   one of the first attempts toward a generalized alternative language that
   is based, on human factors of familiarity. It is ideal for documents
   with a simple yet highly recognizable layout (e.g., poems, dictionaries,
   journals, etc.). We present the QBT language and report results from an
   initial usability test that shows promise for this type of an interface
   as a generalized user-database communication method.},

Abstract = {Asynchronous-distributed (AD) collaborative writing (CW) is an important
   form of the growing trend of distributed work. However, AD CW typically
   results in multiple process losses. We argue that using advanced writing
   technologies designed for AD work alone is not sufficient by itself to
   overcome these losses. Instead, adopting high levels of process
   structure delivered in the form of explicitly written procedural scripts
   can improve the results of AD CW groups. We performed an experiment With
   over 500 participants working in groups supported by advanced CW
   technologies that were designed for AD work. Participants were given six
   weeks to conduct their work. We found that high levels of process
   structure in novice AD CW groups that worked oil a moderately complex
   task created significantly better out-comes than did groups using low
   levels of process structure. Groups with high levels of process
   structure had better results in terms of production, document quality,
   satisfaction. relationships. and communication. In no case did
   low-structure groups out perform high-structure groups. This research
   supports our hypothesis that increased process structure delivered in
   the form of a repeatable process script can decrease process losses and
   increase process gains in novice AD CW groups. We conclude that it is
   not sufficient to give novice AD writing groups CW technology and time
   to conduct their tasks; these groups also need appropriate procedural
   support, which can be provided effectively through written scripts.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In the US, hundreds of thousands of individuals with
   visual disabilities work in occupations that typically entail editing
   text. Editing technologies for blind or visually impaired people have
   been analyzed by researchers for usability, accessibility, and
   feasibility. However, a tutorial is needed to provide blind or visually
   impaired workers with information on how to use these technologies. Key
   lessons: The study's blind coauthor (who prefers this terminology) draws
   on her academic and professional experience to provide procedural
   information for blind or visually impaired practitioners and students
   who need to open email attachments, navigate files, select text,
   navigate the Review tab of Microsoft Word, add comments, and use Nav
   Quick Keys. Implications for practice: This tutorial indicates that word
   processors, screen readers, refreshable braille displays, and braille
   notetakers provide ways for blind or visually impaired practitioners and
   students to edit text. The tutorial also provides insight into one blind
   editor's editing process and provides instructions for duplicating this
   process. This information can increase the awareness of sighted
   practitioners and teachers who seek to make workplaces more accessible
   for blind or visually impaired colleagues.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Pages = {137-153},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: People born between 1995 and 2012, referred to as Generation
   Z, grew up alongside significant technological advancements in
   communication. This cohort's oldest members are now entering the
   workforce. Literature review: Although the merits of generational
   research have been questioned, Generation Z's personal communication
   preferences and habits demonstrate unprecedented technological
   experiences and expectations in the workplace. Research questions: 1.
   What are Generation Z's current habits in using smart technology, social
   media, and voice communication for personal communication? 2. How does
   the current workplace communication environment appear through the lens
   of Generation Z? 3. Do the personal communication habits of Generation Z
   conflict with current workplaces? Methodology: The study reports on a
   207-participant exploratory survey and 6 interviews with Generation Z
   members in January-March 2020. The survey included multiple choice and
   open-ended questions regarding respondents' personal and workplace
   communication habits and expectations. The interviews allowed further
   investigation of survey responses. Results: Working Generation Z
   respondents hold unexpected attitudes and behaviors, including awareness
   of the negatives of technology use, differences in personal preferences
   and professional behaviors, self-regulation of technology use, and
   concern for boundaries between personal and work life. Conclusion:
   Generation Z's ability to adapt to current workplace norms may slow
   changes in workplace communication. Their awareness of disruptive
   communication habits could make positive changes to workplace
   communication in the future. Employers should resist negative
   generational stereotypes and develop new communication policies to
   reflect current and future-looking technology use. This study was
   completed prior to COVID-19 and does not include pandemic-related
   workplace technology changes.},

Title = {The Construction of Interpersonal Meanings in the <i>iPhone 1</i>
   Product Launch Presentation: Integrating Verbal and Visual Semiotics},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {64},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research problem: Discourse bridges between the speakers and the
   audience in product launches. However, how the verbals and the visuals
   work together in the construction of interpersonal meanings in such
   communication remains largely underexplored. Research question: How were
   interpersonal meanings constructed via verbal and visual semiotics in
   the iPhone 1 product launch presentation?. Literature review: Despite
   the recognized importance of innovation communication, communication at
   the launch phase is underexplored. Moreover, communication and
   management studies have generally neglected the role of grammar-based
   discourse in promoting innovation, while linguistic studies have paid
   inadequate attention to language's implications for innovation
   communication and management. Thus, we address the discursive building
   of interpersonal meanings in product launch presentations to fill such
   gaps. Methodology: Integrating Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar
   and Kress and van Leeuwen's Systemic Visual Grammar, we conduct both
   verbal and visual analyses to explore the construction of interpersonal
   meanings in Steve Jobs' iPhone 1 launch presentation. Results: Analysis
   of the verbal strategies suggests that Jobs built different interactive
   roles as an authority innovation leader and as a close ``friend{''}
   willing to engage with the audience. Moreover, by combining verbal
   semiotics with the delicate arrangement of image act, size of frame, and
   angle, the presentation video was carefully planned to create offer
   contact, produce close social distance, and present equal and objective
   attitudes to further enhance the construction of interpersonal meanings,
   thus contributing to the audience's understanding and recognition of the
   innovative product. Conclusions: This article offers insights into
   innovation discourse and communication by investigating the semiotic
   features of the iPhone 1 product launch presentation, thus adding to the
   extant literature on professional communication and innovation
   management.},

Abstract = {Background: Recordings of gamers interacting with video games have
   become a mainstay of online video-sharing communities such as YouTube.
   Sometimes called Let's Play videos, those recordings include content
   relatable to usability testing sessions and potentially illustrate basic
   think-aloud protocols. Literature review: Research regarding think-aloud
   protocols indicates that the use of video to review concurrent user
   commentary is a valid usability testing technique, including sessions
   that include little to no tester instruction or intervention. Evaluation
   using a heuristic created for the studied interface can support this
   type of usability testing. Research questions: 1. Based on a heuristic
   created from video game usability research, do Let's Play videos provide
   content representative of think-aloud protocols regarding usability of
   the games played? 2. Are relevant Let's Play videos potentially useful
   tools for illustrating think-aloud protocols to students unfamiliar with
   this type of usability testing? Methods: After reviewing research
   concerning video game heuristics to create a common set of guidelines,
   the author selected and reviewed five YouTube videos, gathering and
   coding information related to the heuristic. Results: The recordings
   were found to contain relevant information regarding video game
   usability based on the criteria developed from the literature,
   specifically considering verbalizations relative to think-aloud
   protocols. Conclusion: Because these gaming videos contain commentary
   measurable against a research-based heuristic for game usability, they
   could be used as an additional method to introduce think-aloud protocols
   to usability students.},

Title = {Establishing Effective Global Virtual Student Teams},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research problem: In the educational arena, virtual teams made up of
   students who are located in more than one country are becoming
   increasingly commonplace. However, studies of the technological, social,
   and organizational factors that contribute to the success of these
   global virtual student teams (GVSTs) have yet to be systematically
   identified and discussed. In this paper, we seek to address this gap in
   our knowledge, drawing on several years of experience with GVSTs and
   addressing the following research question: How can university
   instructors establish effective GVST projects? Situating the case: The
   cases that we explore in this paper involve GVSTs with team members
   located variously in Hong Kong (all four cases), the USA (two cases),
   the UK (one case), and Singapore (one case). Students are a mix of
   undergraduate and graduate. How the case was studied: Our pedagogical
   purpose for running the GVST projects was to expose students to
   international communication and negotiation practices. The case designs
   involved situations where the student team members had to work
   collaboratively on a variety of tasks. We collected observational data
   and survey data, and required the team members to submit individual
   reflective reports about their learning experiences. About the case: We
   examine cultural differences among teams. We also note how issues of
   time and space vary across these teams, and consider how sufficient
   trust may be developed between team members to ensure productive work.
   Conclusion: From the four cases, we elicit 10 pertinent operational
   factors that should be of value to educators planning GVST projects.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Web 2.0 applications, such as instant messengers and
   other social media platforms, are fast becoming ubiquitous in
   organizations, yet their impact on work performance is poorly
   understood. Research question: What is the relationship between Web 2.0
   use, and work-based communication processes and outcomes in China?
   Literature review: Literature in the fields of information systems and
   media and communication research supports the value of Web 2.0 for
   organizations. However, how Web 2.0 can facilitate the organizational
   communication process and subsequently improve performance is
   underinvestigated. By adapting and extending the communicative ecology
   framework and previously published work, we developed and tested a
   theoretical model to investigate these impacts in the Chinese workplace.
   Methodology: We conducted a quantitative study using the survey method,
   with participants randomly selected from a panel database in China.
   Results and conclusions: We analyzed survey data from 179 organizational
   employees and found that vertical and horizontal communication
   contribute significantly to individual and teamwork performance, with
   high levels of variance explained. In this study, we provide empirical
   evidence of how Web 2.0 applications enable employees to reach out to
   collaborators and business partners, thereby boosting individual
   productivity and team collaboration. The study also highlights the fit
   between Web 2.0 and the need for organizational horizontal communication
   in this era of knowledge, information, and creativity. Future
   researchers should verify the research model in different countries,
   including local contextual characteristics as either independent
   variables or moderators.},

Title = {Differential Effects of the Volume and Diversity of Communication
   Network Ties on Knowledge Workers' Performance},

Abstract = {Research problem: For knowledge workers, such as IT professionals, the
   ties within their social network are a major channel for communicating
   the requisite knowledge and information. While prior studies tended to
   favor higher network centrality (i.e., larger volume of network ties),
   in this study, the researchers argue that centrality can reduce
   communication efficiency if the diversity of the ties is low. Research
   question: Which characteristic of communication ties, volume or
   diversity, has more influence on knowledge workers' performance?
   Literature review: Using social network analysis (SNA) as the
   theoretical framework, a review of the literature shows that social
   network ties have important performance implications because they can
   enhance an individual's access to valued resources. Studies have also
   examined the performance impact of ``hindrance network centrality,{''}
   or how frequently a person is described by other network members as a
   hindrance to their performance. However, current research has overlooked
   the possible negative communication consequences of centrality in
   regards to redundant information, which may negatively affect job
   performance. Methodology: The current study employs a quantitative
   approach, using the standard SNA method of a ``name generator{''}
   questionnaire to collect network data. Participants were 98 people in
   the IT department at a large defense company. We identified 3905
   relationships and analyzed them with the UCINET software. Subsequently,
   social network variables, as well as performance and human capital
   variables were analyzed in logistic regressions. Results and discussion:
   Results showed a significant relationship between constraint, a measure
   of tie diversity, and performance. Centrality, the measure of tie
   volume, however, was not significantly related to performance. Our
   findings about the volume versus diversity of communication ties have
   important implications for professional communicators in the age of
   fast-growing social network media. A limitation of our study is that we
   approximated communication ties with social network links. We suggest
   that future studies further validate our findings by using a more direct
   measure of communication ties.},

Title = {Style Congruency and Persuasion: A Cross-cultural Study Into the
   Influence of Differences in Style Dimensions on the Persuasiveness of
   Business Newsletters in Great Britain and the Netherlands},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of the present study was to investigate
   whether style congruency on the dimensions succinct-elaborate and
   instrumental-affective influenced the persuasiveness of business
   newsletters in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Research question: Is
   a writing style more persuasive in a country with cultural preferences
   that are congruent with this writing style? Literature review: The
   purpose of the literature review was to present two theoretical
   frameworks for investigating cross-cultural differences in style
   preferences. Theories about cross-cultural differences in value
   orientations show that value orientations can be linked to
   cross-cultural differences in persuasion. Theories about cross-cultural
   differences in communication styles show that preferences for particular
   communication styles can be linked to cultural value orientations.
   Methodology: Two quantitative experimental studies were conducted among
   344 business-to-business customers of a company in the Netherlands and
   Great Britain. Using seven-point scales, participants evaluated
   different versions of a newsletter on comprehensibility, attractiveness,
   and intention to order goods. Statistical analyses included general
   linear model (GLM) repeated measures and two-way ANOVAs. Results and
   discussion: Findings reveal limited differences between the Dutch and
   British participants in preferences for communication styles.
   Consequently, it may not be worthwhile for organizations to adjust the
   style of their documents to preferences in different cultures. A
   limitation of the current study was that it only investigated style
   preferences for one particular business genre (i.e., newsletters).
   Future research should investigate stylistic preferences in other
   business genres and in other cultures.},

Abstract = {The assessment of engineering products and services is central to the
   work of engineering, but the evaluation of human communication and its
   development in engineering and other technical professions has not yet
   received enough attention in IEEE research and publications. This
   special section begins to remedy this situation by calling for more
   research in the assessment of professional communication skills and
   training programs as well as in the development of better assessment
   tools and procedures. It features four new articles on the topic in the
   hope that these will inspire even more research related to the
   assessment of human communication in scientific and technical
   professions.},

Abstract = {Knowledge transfer among geographically separated members is recognized
   as a critical ingredient for collaborative accomplishment of work in
   virtual teams. However due to the ``localness{''} of knowledge, such
   transfer of knowledge is believed to be inherently problematic; thus, it
   is important to develop a solid understanding of the factors that enable
   knowledge transfer in such contexts. Drawing on existing literature on
   knowledge management and virtual teamwork, we identify four Cs
   (communication, capability, credibility, and culture) associated with
   individuals who transfer significant amounts of knowledge to remote
   members. Next, we test the four Cs in the context of US-Norwegian
   virtual teams engaged in systems development. The volume of
   communication, the credibility of the communicator and the nature of
   cultural values held (i.e., collectivism) by the communicator were found
   to significantly predict the extent of knowledge transferred; although,
   contrary to expectations, capability was not found to have a significant
   influence. A number of implications for virtual team participants and
   professional communicators are articulated. Avenues for future research
   are also suggested.},

Abstract = {Receiving innovative end-user feedback on an information system is
   essential for acquiring further development ideas. The feedback
   gathering method should encourage end users to freely bring out new
   ideas. The method should be repeatable and transferable to allow its use
   in various contexts. We employ the principles of collaboration
   engineering using so-called thinkLets us building blocks to construct a
   feedback gathering process. We apply the principles for receiving new
   development ideas for a multi-university student information system in
   Finland. We reflect on the experiences and give insights on applying two
   alternative processes in a complex organizational context.},

Title = {Planning for Difference: Preparing Students to Create Flexible and
   Elaborated Team Charters that Can Adapt to Support Diverse Teams},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: A robust body of research supports the use of team charters
   to purposefully create a team culture with shared norms and
   expectations. However, student teams often treat this requirement as
   busywork and fail to invest the effort needed to create team charters
   that prepare the team to adapt for obstacles that they may encounter.
   Situating the case: Teams that do not engage in effective planning for
   their collaborations are likely to encounter a range of problems
   including slackers, domineering teammates, curtailed learning
   opportunities, and general exclusion from the project work-problems that
   are often exacerbated on diverse teams and that disproportionately
   affect marginalized populations. About the case: We created three online
   modules that help students uncover their own tacit expectations for
   teamwork, share and merge these expectations, and then construct a team
   charter and task schedules with their teammates. Methods: We used a
   quasiexperimental design comparing team charters from control and
   experimental groups to understand how our modules affected students'
   charters at a university with a highly international population.
   Results: Analyses revealed that control group charters tended to invoke
   universal team norms and assign punishments for failing to uphold those
   norms. By contrast, experimental group charters were more flexible,
   acknowledged competing priorities, evidenced greater planning, and
   articulated processes that could accommodate individual goals, values,
   and constraints. Conclusions: Charters created after the modules showed
   more accommodation of difference; however, more research needs to be
   done to determine whether the more flexible and elaborated charters
   improve team behaviors.},

Title = {A Corpus-Assisted Critical Discourse Analysis of News Construction of
   the Flint Water Crisis},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {450-466},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: News media play a critical role in communicating risks and
   shaping public perceptions of social issues. Covering a multilayered
   disaster that grew from a local story to a national one, the ways that
   news media at different levels construct the Flint water crisis have not
   been previously explored. Literature review: Despite the
   well-established role of journalism as a government watchdog, news media
   do not neutrally mirror every social event. Instead, news reporting,
   highly mediated by language, is filled with political interests, values,
   and attitudes. Research questions: 1. How did local/regional and
   national newspapers construct the Flint water crisis? 2. Are there any
   similarities and/or differences in local/regional and national news
   construction of the Flint water crisis? 3. What are the practical
   implications for media coverage of risks, emergencies, or crises? 4.
   What are the methodological implications of this study for professional
   communication research? Methodology: This study integrates corpus
   linguistics and critical discourse analysis to analyze 1858 news reports
   about the Flint water crisis published between 2014 and 2018. I use
   keywords as a core analytical technique to compare the local/regional
   and national news coverage. Results: The results show that both local
   and national news reports overemphasized government activities while
   downplaying the unofficial voices of Flint residents and community
   activists. In addition, national newspapers were more likely than local
   newspapers to use racial cues in describing the Flint community and to
   associate the crisis with other social problems. Conclusions: This study
   suggests that news media should provide wide coverage of the affected
   community's efforts in risk/crisis communication rather than reproducing
   official messages. News representations should be cautious of
   strengthening stereotypes or forming negative conceptual associations of
   traditionally disenfranchised communities.},

Abstract = {Background: The Washington Post's Fatal Force fatal police shooting
   database was first created in 2015 to fill a gap in official data
   collection on police use of force. Literature review: Critical data
   studies scholarship suggests that data system design is rhetorical and
   communicates cultural values, not just numerical data. Narrative
   research methods, which focus on thick, rich contextual data, could help
   address the rhetorical and cultural dimensions of data system design.
   Research questions: 1. How do data collection, aggregation, and curation
   practices influence data stories about crime and violence? 2. How does
   Fatal Force, a data system about police use of force that originated
   outside law enforcement, prioritize and organize information? 3. How
   does designing data systems with explicit, highly specific goals and
   aims (like the inclusion criteria and purpose of Fatal Force) influence
   the system as a whole? Methodology: Using ``unblackboxing,{''} a
   combination of narrative and critical data studies methods, I analyzed
   the Fatal Force database and its accompanying data stories. I compare
   this database with its institutional counterpart in the FBI's fledgling
   Use of Force database. Results: Fatal Force is constructed with
   particular attention to questions that users may have about police
   brutality, police shootings, and race. Fatal Force's data stories use
   narrative commonplaces like sociality and temporality to humanize the
   issue of police use of force and communicate greater nuance. The FBI's
   Use of Force database shows an orientation toward police perceptions of
   use-of-force incidents and a lack of attention to national conversations
   about police brutality. Conclusions: Data systems show clear
   perspectives on the issues that they describe, which influence how users
   encounter the data system, how useful the system can be for various
   users, and how inclusive or just the data system is.},

Abstract = {Background: Accessibility of digital materials within workplaces
   continues to be an issue that is not readily and completely addressed
   through legal compliance and institutional policy. Despite the lack of
   marked improvement in digital accessibility, many continue to pursue a
   policy approach to accessibility, including checklists and guidelines.
   Literature review: Despite the attention paid to accessibility and
   surrounding issues by scholars in the field of technical and
   professional communication, little direction has been given to help
   practitioners advocate for accessibility in the workplace. Research
   question: Can common ground between institutional values and
   accessibility be discovered and leveraged to motivate value-driven
   accessibility? Research methods: Common ground theory was used to code
   and analyze data obtained from research interviews of 18 university
   instructors to determine how they consider accessibility within the
   process of developing their course documents. Data were coded and
   analyzed to discover common attitudes toward accessibility. Results and
   discussion: The data revealed that although instructors approached
   accessibility differently, all were motivated to work for student
   success, a fact that indicated common ground between instructor
   practices and accessibility. This finding suggests that accessibility
   advocates can motivate value-driven accessibility by leveraging common
   ground. Conclusion: I used the revealed common ground to inform the
   development of a digital accessibility resource, which underwent
   usability testing. My research-informed design process illustrates that
   despite institutional variability, technical and professional
   communicators can find and leverage common ground to move away from a
   singular, policy-driven approach to accessibility in favor of a more
   sustainable value-driven accessibility, which generates and supports
   long-term accessibility design.},

Abstract = {Research problem: During humanitarian crises, communities of people face
   various types of dangers. To counter the dangers, they need information
   in a short period. Such need creates the opportunity for misinformation.
   Such misinformation can result in information harms that can generate
   short- or long-term consequences. Literature review: Prior researchers
   have tackled the situation by using technical or behavioral approaches.
   Research question: What are the harms from misinformation? We propose a
   taxonomy of 15 information harms grouped in 8 categories and assess the
   perception of risk regarding the harms through a survey of respondents
   who have experienced crisis response situations. Methodology: This paper
   examines two scenarios, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the 2017
   Oroville Dam evacuation order crises, through two dimensions: Likelihood
   of occurrence and Level of impacts of the harms. Results and
   conclusions: Findings are presented through visualization and test
   results for significant differences of harms between scenarios. Similar
   groups of harms are identified with different severity levels based on
   post hoc analyses: those with 1. high likelihood and low impact
   (psychological and confusion harms), 2. low likelihood and low impact
   (reputation and privacy harms), and 3. low likelihood and high impact
   (physical, financial, safety, and social harms). In addition to
   establishing the taxonomy of misinformation harms, findings will have
   practical value in emergency response and recovery activities to
   effectively prioritize resources to minimize specific harms from
   misinformation in crises. Further research directions are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Background: Successful team collaborations require psychological safety
   (PS)-a measure that addresses how individuals perceive their own
   behaviors in a team, allowing members to be comfortable being
   themselves. Technical communication curricula do not engage deeply with
   managing the socioemotional components of collaboration. Literature
   review: Scholarship addressing hundreds of teams with thousands of
   members concludes that psychological safety has a direct influence on
   task performance. Few studies track psychological safety across a team's
   lifecycle, and different professions exhibit a wide range of PS values.
   Extensive research indicates that collaboration can be improved by
   training. Research questions: 1. Will a targeted training intervention
   produce higher levels of psychological safety? 2. Does team duration
   affect teaming success as exemplified by psychological safety,
   satisfaction, and cohesion? Methods: Our multisite longitudinal study
   surveyed 215 students in 50+ short- and long-term teams to understand
   the effects of a specific training intervention (a PS learning module).
   Results and discussion: Training had no significant impact, but targeted
   training might still increase psychological safety. Short-term teams
   experienced significantly better psychological safety over long-term
   teams, and psychological safety improved the more time members spent in
   teams. Comparisons within longitudinal intervals were also significant,
   indicating that different team contexts influenced our results.
   Implications and future research: Results suggest that incorporating
   team-specific training may facilitate building a personal awareness of
   interdependence among team members. Moreover, research should account
   for contextual differences and use longitudinal team self-assessments.
   Future research should concentrate on identifying a range of viability
   for PS useful in benchmarking.},

Abstract = {Background: This study adopted a corpus-linguistics approach to
   investigate the gender effects in students' technical and scientific
   writing. Specifically, we analyzed whether gender influenced how males
   and females used adverbs (e. g., very, really, and definitely) and
   passive voice (e. g., the article was published in the journal). The
   overuse of both adverbs and passive voice has been associated with poor
   writing clarity and concision. Literature review: Previous research
   works on gender effects in language have been mixed. Since these are all
   the essential elements of effective technical communication, teachers
   need to know what gender effects might exist. Research questions are as
   follows: 1. Does gender influence the student writers' use of adverbs?
   2. Does gender influence the student writers' use of passive voice?
   Methodology: The sample included 87 writers (46 females and 41 males)
   who contributed to a 757,533-word corpus. Researchers analyzed 12,111
   instances of adverbs and 4,732 instances of passive voice within a
   variety of technical texts. Results/discussion: Female writers used
   significantly more adverbs as well as more additive/restrictive, degree,
   and stance adverbs than expected. Male writers used more linking and
   manner adverbs than expected. Female writers also used significantly
   more passives, particularly passive verbs associated with reporting
   findings and interpretation. In contrast, male writers associated with
   passive verbs used to describe methods and analyses. Overall, the
   results suggested that females and males used the same style markers to
   fulfill different rhetorical functions.},

Abstract = {Background: With communication skills deemed increasingly important for
   engineering graduates, we wanted to understand how writing is currently
   included in engineering classes, what challenges are caused by including
   writing in such classes, and what resources would be most useful to help
   engineering instructors more easily include writing in engineering
   classes. Literature review: Writing is a necessary skill for engineering
   graduates and has received increased attention in engineering classes.
   However, despite many instructors' beliefs that writing is an important
   skill for engineers, it is not typically taught in a systematic and
   comprehensive way across the engineering curriculum. Research questions:
   1. What perceptions of writing, and specifically writing in engineering,
   do engineering instructors hold? 2. To what extent do engineering
   instructors report incorporation of writing activities and assignments
   in their classes? 3. What barriers do engineering instructors perceive
   as inhibiting the inclusion of more writing in engineering courses? 4.
   What resources do engineering instructors desire to expand and improve
   the inclusion of writing in engineering courses? Research methods: A
   survey was completed by engineering instructional staff (n = 190
   respondents, 10.7\% response rate) from seven institutions as well as by
   some members of the Big10+ Engineering Deans Mailing List. Instructors
   were asked about their general perceptions about writing in engineering
   and were also asked to consider the most recent engineering course that
   they taught and reflect on how they included (or did not include)
   writing in their course. Findings and conclusions: As expected, we found
   that most engineering instructional staff agree that writing skills are
   very important in engineering. Yet, we found that constraints on time
   and resources kept instructors from including more writing in their
   courses. This paper concludes with a discussion of our efforts to
   develop resources, such as rubrics, graded writing examples, and
   strategies for developing writing prompts, to help instructors include
   more writing in their engineering courses.},

Title = {Remaking the Pitch: Reuse Strategies in Entrepreneurs' Pitch Decks},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Research problem: Examines how Korean entrepreneurs in an
   entrepreneurship program revised their English-language slide decks for
   their competitive presentations ({''}pitches{''}) by reusing content
   from professional communication genres, including their own documents
   and feedback from potential stakeholders in their target markets.
   Research question: As entrepreneurs learn to pitch ideas to unfamiliar
   markets, how do they revise their slide decks by reusing content from
   other professional communication genres? Specifically, what strategies
   do they follow when reusing content? Literature review: The professional
   communication literature demonstrates that reuse tends to take place in
   documentation cycles where documents are set in interaction with each
   other and that reuse itself involves rhetorical choices. Yet such reuse
   strategies have not been examined in existing studies of entrepreneurial
   pitches in marketing and technology commercialization. Methodology: In
   an exploratory qualitative study, researchers textually analyzed 14 sets
   of five related document genres in the archives of an entrepreneurship
   program. These genres represented a full cycle of activity: application
   to the program, initial pitches, initial feedback from program
   personnel, detailed feedback from representative stakeholders in the
   target market, and revised pitches. Interviews and surveys of program
   personnel further contextualize the data. Results and conclusions:
   Entrepreneurs reused content from professional communication genres,
   including those that they had generated as well as those generated by
   market stakeholders. However, reuse went simply beyond accepting and
   copying feedback; as they learned to make their pitch arguments, these
   entrepreneurs had to weigh this feedback and engage with it critically.
   This reuse can be characterized as Accepting (repeating verbatim or in
   close paraphrase); Continuing (extending lines of argument); and
   Resisting (rebutting lines of argument). These findings suggest that
   entrepreneurs need all three strategies as they refine their pitches for
   their target markets.},

Title = {Integrating Online Informative Videos into Technical Communication

Abstract = {Background: Online, informative videos are a popular genre of technical
   communication but little information is available for instructors to
   integrate the genre into technical communication courses. Research
   questions: (1) What are the logistics, considerations, and problems
   encountered when assigning authentic informative videos in introductory
   technical writing service courses? (2) Is an authentic informative video
   project in introductory technical writing service courses an effective
   learning assignment from the students' perspectives? Situating the case:
   Video has been discussed in technical communication literature since the
   1970s and our discussion of video parallels technology development
   making video production and viewing possible for mainstream consumers.
   Recently, a revitalization of interest in video (particularly since
   2012) reflects widespread adoption of smart phones with video recording
   capabilities, preinstalled and relatively simple video production
   applications on computers, video-sharing websites (YouTube), and
   high-speed internet connections enabling rapid video downloads by
   viewers. Yet, low-cost and easy-to-use communication technologies are
   often associated with the idiosyncratic application of design features
   and often do not transfer into effective communication. We often claim
   that technical communication programs are well situated to take a
   ``leadership role{''} in mastering a new communication technology but
   our instruction of video has not kept pace with the rapidly evolving
   technology nor is it necessarily consistent with our own research
   findings. How this case was studied: In this experience report, I took a
   teacher-researcher role and triangulated my personal observations with a
   student-perception questionnaire and other student reflections on the
   assignment. About the case: The informative video project was used in a
   junior-level, introductory technical communication service course. The
   informative video assignment was an experiential learning assignment in
   which students worked in small teams to develop ``real-world{''}
   communications for a peer audience. The learning objectives emphasized
   in the project include genre analysis, audience analysis, scriptwriting,
   visual-verbal communication, video production and technology, and
   project management and teamwork. Results: The logistics and
   considerations for developing informative videos in technical
   communication courses are discussed and student feedback reveals that
   this assignment was particularly useful for teaching audience analysis,
   technology skills, verbal-visual synergy of communication channels, and
   teamwork. Conclusions: Informative videos are a challenging project but
   offer a unique opportunity to examine audience analysis and teach
   verbal-visual parallelism. Furthermore, the equipment and production
   software are no longer barriers to assigning the project in technical
   communication courses.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of this study was to investigate the
   effects of two types of motivational elements-verification steps and
   personal stories-in an instruction manual for a cell phone targeted at
   senior users (between 60 and 70 years). Research questions: What are the
   effects of adding verification steps and personal stories to an
   instruction manual on: (1) Seniors' confidence in being able to work
   with a cell phone? (2) Seniors' motivation to work with a cell phone?
   (3) Seniors' effectiveness and efficiency in performing tasks, and their
   satisfaction with the cell phone and the instruction manual (usability)?
   Literature review: To optimize products and services for older users,
   the literature suggests that two specific motivational elements may be
   beneficial: (1) verification steps, which provide information at the end
   of procedures to allow users to check if these procedures were performed
   correctly. These appear to users as part of conventional procedural
   information in user instructions and (2) personal stories, which are
   anecdotes or testimonials that describe how a fictitious user succeeded
   in completing a procedure. Methodology: We conducted a quantitative
   experiment in which 59 seniors between 60 and 70 years of age
   participated. They performed a number of tasks with a cell phone, using
   a version of the instruction manual with added verification steps, or a
   version with additional personal stories, or a control version without
   motivational elements. We measured participants' confidence, their
   motivation, and usability by asking them to answer several
   questionnaires and by measuring task performance. Results and
   conclusions: Results support the use of verification steps or personal
   stories as motivational elements in user instructions as they can
   positively affect confidence, motivation, and usability, especially when
   senior users encounter setbacks.},

Abstract = {Technology use and adaptation are the center of attention in research on
   virtual teams. Through empirical observations from six interpretative
   cases of virtual teams, we suggest conceptualizing the relationship
   between technology-use practices and collaborative practices as a

   four key perspectives on technology-use practices: continuous iterative
   process, reflection-on-action activities, malleability and
   reconfigurability, and transformation. Moreover, we show how these four
   key perspectives influence the design, the outcome, the task processes,

Abstract = {A major challenge in engineering education is to prepare professionals
   for communicating well in writing and speaking, using appropriate
   technologies, within professional contexts. Communication in the global
   engineering world includes collaboration on cross-functional teams,
   virtual-project team management, and writing for multiple, complex
   audiences. This tutorial discusses how one small engineering school has
   integrated technical communication teaching and assessment throughout
   the curriculum with demonstrated success. The integrated curriculum,
   formative and summative assessments, and real-world contexts offer one
   model to address growing communication challenges.},

Abstract = {Adopting the supply chain paradigm, we define customer service as a
   multifunctional sequence of process activities supported by an intricate
   tapestry of information technology (IT) and non-IT resources that enable
   the coordination and communication necessary to create value for the
   customer. The resource-based view (RBV) serves as our theoretical lens
   for assessing the strategic contributions of IT in the customer-service
   process of third-party logistics firms. Our findings support the RBV
   assertion of significant direct and indirect impacts but suggest that
   the challenges of fully integrating IT resources as process components
   go beyond merely leveraging complementarity, as emphasized by RBV.},

Abstract = {Many organizations are constantly changing their web presence. Despite
   the frequency of these redesigns, there appears to be little evidence to
   explain what kinds of changes are incorporated into each updated version
   of a web presence. To understand how commercial organizations transform
   their web presence, we conduct a content analysis and a cluster analysis
   of press releases describing redesign initiatives in the late 1990s.
   Findings suggest that the majority of companies redesigned their web
   presence to expand information and change navigation protocols.
   Surprisingly, the addition of interactive features such as online
   ordering and community communication channels is present in only 20\% of
   the redesign cases studied. According to the groups provided by the
   cluster analysis, most of the changes reported in these press releases
   are centered on improving the usability of the web presence. Based on
   this evidence, we conclude that initial transformations to commercial
   websites were more driven by the need to effectively communicate new
   information than by the addition of e-commerce features.},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Problem: A Ph.D. is an extended study that requires an initial plan to
   conceptualize a research project, which is then refined, with results
   presented in a written dissertation. Diverse entry pathways to research
   mean that many Ph.D. candidates may experience difficulties in
   conceptualizing, aligning, and writing up their projects. Thus, there is
   a need for an effective framework to help students conceptualize their
   research, as well as a mechanism to transfer it to writing in the
   required genres. Key lessons: We present the Plan, Organize, Write,
   Research (POWR) framework. POWR proposes a way to link a sociocognitive
   and sociocultural planning process and the structuring of research
   communication. The framework has two stages: POWRa and POWRb. POWRa
   provides a way to conceptualize the iterative planning process
   underpinning a long-term project, and provides a bridge to POWRb, the
   more formal genre communication of the project, through the dissertation
   document. Implications for practice: The tutorial provides a framework
   to articulate a research project in a supervisory and team environment.
   It uses terminology and structure relevant to engineering and
   information technology theses to illustrate the framework. The framework
   provides an iterative decision-making structure that is systematic,
   explicit, and equitable for research project planning and transfer into
   the writing genre of doctoral dissertations.},

Abstract = {Background: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports are one of the
   vehicles for developing corporate images, namely, the cognitive
   representation of a company perceived by the concerned stakeholders. It
   would be interesting to compare the CSR reports of companies of the
   world's two largest economies: the US and China. Literature review:
   Previous studies of CSR reports tend to highlight their
   lexicogrammatical, semantic, and functional features at the discursive
   level, but few studies have examined the cognitive images that companies
   intend to develop at the level of conceptual structure (knowledge
   representation). This study investigates metaphor use as a discursive
   and cognitive strategy for developing corporate images in Chinese and
   American CSR reports from the perspective of corpus-based conceptual
   metaphor analysis, particularly based on the concept of genre-specific
   metaphors, the metaphors used to conventionally construe notions for a
   certain communicative purpose achieved by a particular discourse
   community. Research questions: 1. What are the major concerns of Chinese
   and American CSR reports? 2. What are the genre-specific metaphors used
   to construe major concerns of Chinese and American CSR reports? 3. What
   do the genre-specific metaphors reveal about the corporate images of
   Chinese and US companies? Are there differences in developing corporate
   images between Chinese and American CSR reports? Methodology: We
   collected CSR reports of the top companies in China and the US,
   identified genre-specific linguistic and conceptual metaphors, and
   conducted comparative analysis of metaphor-based corporate images.
   Results and conclusions: The conceptual metaphors genre-specific to CSR
   reports are BUSINESSES ARE OBJECTS, BUSINESS IS WAR, BUSINESS IS A
   JOURNEY, and BUSINESS COMPETITION IS COMPETITIVE GAMES/SPORTS.
   Furthermore, CSR reports of both countries share most genre-specific
   metaphor parings and thus nearly the same mappings, which contribute to
   building corporate images of being economically competitive, ethically
   cooperative, and environmentally responsible. Although both stress
   self-development and taking a leading position, American companies seem
   to pay more attention to external cooperation with others. On the other
   hand, Chinese companies seem to stress internal cooperation and a
   well-organized hierarchy. Admittedly, this study may be limited in terms
   of analyzing only genre-specific metaphors and not balancing sector
   types of the companies in the two corpora.},

Abstract = {Research problem: In the current information age, people are
   increasingly accustomed to sharing their special interests online and
   are influenced by the relationships developed from that sharing. The
   purpose of this study was to better measure peer influence in these
   online communities. Research questions: 1. How can peer influence in
   online communities be measured in a way that comprehensively
   incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the
   structural position of a user in the network? 2. Is the method proposed
   in this study superior to other existing methods? Literature review:
   Previous literature on measuring online user influence can be classified
   into two streams: 1. Those that focus on the intrinsic characteristics
   of social media players to measure peer influence; 2. Those that address
   social network structure. Relevant computing algorithms include
   Topic-Based PageRank, Quality-Structure index, and so on. Although the
   first stream considers a focal peer's intrinsic characteristics, it
   overlooks the interpeer attraction in terms of similarity and discrepant
   knowledge among peers. The second stream mostly stresses the structures
   of social networks to measure network-wide peer influence but
   underestimates the effect of interpeer attraction that may leverage
   every diffusion step of peer influence through the network. To fill this
   research gap, this study proposes a new method of measuring network user
   influence that incorporates peers' intrinsic factors, interpeer
   influence factors as homophily effect, and network structure. Homophily
   refers to the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are
   similar with respect to certain attributes. Methodology: From the
   communication sender-receiver perspective, we developed a computable
   method that incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily
   effect, and the structural position of a user in the network to measure
   the social network user influence. Two empirical studies were
   subsequently conducted in a social network service-based online
   community and an online professional logistics community to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and conclusions: The
   empirical results show that our proposed method provides higher
   prediction accuracy of user influence rank in an online community than
   the other existing methods. These findings lay a foundation for future
   theoretical exploration and provide a useful tool for targeting
   influential users in online communities such as blogs, bulletin board
   systems, and forums.},

Abstract = {Research problem: This study investigates entrepreneurship as a
   rhetorical practice and seeks to illustrate how narratives of
   individuals from different cultures create a discourse of
   entrepreneurship. We offer theoretical and methodological considerations
   for comparative international analyses in entrepreneurship research.
   Research questions: (1) How do the stories that are told by
   entrepreneurs from different cultures reveal their values? (2) What can
   those stories tell us about entrepreneurship in different cultures?
   Literature review: An emerging stream of authors proposes to study
   entrepreneurship from individual narratives, but studies on
   entrepreneurship rhetorics are scarce, seldom use an international
   approach, and rarely cover the cultural aspects. Methodology: We
   collected entrepreneurial narratives in the US, Spain, and China, and
   deployed a novel two-fold method to retain cultural nuances and validate
   translation accuracy. Narrative data were studied based upon the coding,
   constant comparison, and memo writing used in grounded theory. Results
   and conclusions: We identify three core metaphorical devices used by
   participants to structure their entrepreneurial journeys (action and
   learning, autonomy and money, and exceptionalism and networks), and we
   suggest that the use of these metaphorical pairs varies both within and
   across cultures. These findings offer preliminary evidence, for the
   first time in the literature, that building a rhetorical understanding
   of entrepreneurship requires that we consider two axes: the individual
   and the cultural.},

Title = {Revising a Content-Management Course for a Content Strategy World},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Background: This teaching case describes the evolution of a course on
   content strategy aimed at advanced undergraduates and graduate students
   in the digital and professional writing programs at Michigan State
   University. The course has gone through three major shifts to reflect
   corresponding shifts in focus among professional and technical
   communicators: from developing content for the World Wide Web (original
   focus) to single sourcing; from single-sourcing to Enterprise Content
   Management Systems (ECMS), and from ECMS to content strategy. The case
   primarily focuses on the most recent shift. Research questions: How can
   a course on content strategy be useful to both advanced undergraduates
   preparing to enter the job market in industry and graduate students
   interested in learning theories in technical communication? In turn, how
   can a course on content strategy reflect current practices in industry
   while maintaining grounding for the course in academic research?
   Situating the case: Three emerging themes relevant to teaching content
   strategy emerge in the literature. The first is the role of the content
   strategist as an Editor-in-Chief, who creates a repeatable system for
   designing and managing all aspects of a website {[}1, 2, 3]. The second
   is the need to develop strategies for addressing stakeholders,
   especially clients and users, whose goals are to learn more about why
   they should invest in an organization and its broader vision. The third
   is adapting content for reuse, which involves designing content that can
   be easily accessed through various platforms and formats. How the case
   was studied: This is an experience report by the four faculty members
   who, together, have taught every section of the course in the last 15
   years. Two of the instructors also participated in the course as
   students. About the case: The most recent version of the course is a
   one-term course that teaches theory and best practices for managing
   dynamic and distributed web content, while also incorporating
   assignments that help students practice content strategies with real
   clients. It addressed these issues with the previous version that
   focused on content management by collaborating with industry
   practitioners to help students understand the real-world implications of
   developing strategies for and creating web content with clients and
   organizations. It specifically addresses three themes identified from
   the literature-emphasizing the role of the content strategist as an
   Editor-in-Chief, differentiating the needs of clients and users, and
   designing for reuse. Course assignments include a landscape analysis of
   content-management systems and strategies used by various companies,
   designing content templates for specific clients, and developing a
   content strategy for a client selected by student groups. Key issues to
   address when developing the most recent version of the course included
   creating a course that was useful to graduate and undergraduate students
   aiming to enter content strategy professions, developing a balance
   between theory and practice in course readings and assignments, and
   revising a course to reflect current industry demands for skills in
   content strategy. Results: Anecdotal evidence from students is that the
   course was successful and acts as a defacto capstone for the program.
   Through their course evaluations and unsolicited follow-up emails,
   students exiting the most recent version of this course became valuable
   assets who help organizations develop big-picture strategies for
   adaptable content to be shared through various platforms.
   Conclusion: A course on content strategy that incorporates current
   industry perspectives helps graduate and undergraduate professional
   writing students become more adequately prepared for their future
   professions working with organizations.},

Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Research problem: Subversive environmental texts, those that strive
   against hegemonic discourse, such as the book, have a long history of
   use by radical environmentalists as a means for recruitment and
   distribution of best practices. This study aims to investigate the role
   of plain language in the subversive text, and consider some ethical
   implications of plain language by conducting a close textual analysis.
   Research questions: (1) Is the subversive text Ecodefense an artifact of
   plain language? (2) If Ecodefense is written in plain language, what
   does that suggest about the inherent ethicality of plain language?
   Literature review: Plain language refers to clear expression designed to
   help users achieve desired goals. In the sense that it is a
   communication practice, it is guided by standards put forth by various
   agencies and bureaucratic bodies. In the sense that it is a movement,
   plain language is characterized by the proliferation of organizations
   advocating for plain language practices in society. This study is rooted
   in the investigation of the ethical practices of social movements. It
   considers the ethics of plain language practices when they are put
   toward subversive ends and explores the ethical value of plain language
   itself. Methodology: Ecodefense is analyzed using the Center for Plain
   Language's (CPL) Plain Language checklist and Writemark's criteria for
   documents, which includes consideration of the audience, structure,
   language content, and design of a text, as well as usability testing.
   Results and conclusion: Analysis shows that Ecodefense is partially
   representative of plain language use and practice under the CPL's
   standards, and appears somewhat more fully representative under
   Writemark's standards, which are designed for use by a trained assessor.
   Analysis further suggests that adherence to checklistdriven language
   practices may unwittingly enable an ethic of exigence; thus, research is
   needed into the ethical implications for listdriven, or standardsbased,
   rhetoric in order to ensure that plain language practices consider
   longterm implications for users and for organizations that employ these
   practices.},

Abstract = {This paper reintroduces concepts from sensemaking in Media Synchronicity
   Theory (MST). It focuses on how media should support synchronicity to
   fit communication needs when making sense of a humanitarian crisis
   situation. Findings from interviews with senior management of
   humanitarian aid organizations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
   show that; contrary to what is suggested by MST, low synchronicity media
   are not sufficient to support conveyance processes. Instead, information
   and communication systems should support these actors in connecting,
   building, and maintaining their networks of contacts. Also, information
   and communications systems need to be designed to support the observed
   sensemaking communication activities of noticing, updating, inquiring,
   triangulating, verifying, reflecting, enacting, and interpreting.},

   We draw on experiences at Mercy Corps and the literature on learning

   effective learning solutions: (7) employees' desire to learn versus the
   pressures of the job, (2) investing in strategic learning initiatives
   versus the need to keep organizational operating costs low, (3) formal
   learning versus informal learning, (4) maintaining flexibility within a
   local context versus organization-wide standards that create efficiency
   and accountability, and (5) people versus technology. We offer examples
   of possible solutions to the individual and organizational learning

Abstract = {Writing, especially when accompanied by feedback and revision, is a
   powerful enhancer for learning, as the writing-to-learn literature
   attests. Yet, writing as a vehicle for learning seldom appears in
   engineering content courses. We relate our experiences with a pilot
   program in engineering design funded through the National Science
   Foundation. Specifically. we focus on using Calibrated Peer Review as a
   platform for formative and summative assessment of integrated writing
   assignments in targeted courses. Our results show that students improved
   their skills in elements of engineering design and in writing.
   Additionally, assessment of the learning outcomes from the targeted
   Courses were used successfully to document Accreditation Board for
   Engineering and Technology's criterion EC3 (g), ``ability to communicate
   effectively,{''} in our latest accreditation cycle.},

   that determine user satisfaction with helpdesks and helplines. A survey,
   based on the SERVQUAL framework and questionnaire, shows that the
   SERVQUAL dimensions of customer satisfaction are not applicable in these
   contexts. Three quality dimensions were found instead: solution quality,
   the experience of the consultation, and, in the case of a physical
   environment, the so-called tangibles. Helpdesk customers base their
   overall quality perceptions mainly on their experiences during a
   consultation, while helpline customers focus strongly on the quality of
   the solution offered. The study also found a connection between the

Abstract = {As they guide people in performing a task, procedures are the heart of
   most manuals. It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that the theoretical
   and empirical knowledge of their nature has remained somewhat elusive.
   This paper describes a theoretical framework for procedures, summarized
   as the four components model, which is grounded in systems theory and
   rhetoric. The study addresses two research questions: (1) What are
   procedures made of? and (2) Which design guidelines for procedures can
   be abstracted from theory and research? The model distinguishes between:
   goals, prerequisite states, unwanted states (warnings and
   problem-solving information), and actions and reactions. For each
   component pertinent research findings are summarized and lead to the
   formulation of design guidelines. Occasionally these guidelines are
   compared with existing procedures from a sample of 104 manuals to see
   how well theory and practice agree. The model offers a manageable and
   expandable framework for creating user support that is based on
   scientific research. It can be used for a systematic analysis of
   procedures and for their (re)design.},

Abstract = {Web-based training has been both acclaimed as a self-paced, consistent,
   stand-alone alternative to traditional instructor-led training and
   disparaged for its high development costs and dearth of qualified
   trainers. Critics especially question its effectiveness. This case study
   tests the effectiveness of a stand-alone web-based training program and
   compares the results to that of an identical instructor-led course. The
   course provides highly task-oriented instruction for a computer software
   package and was developed using a proven instructional design
   methodology. The data from this study show that web-based training is as
   effective as instructor-led training for stand-alone software
   application training in a corporation.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the problems that occur in implementing a major
   organizational change initiative where various employee groups have
   different interpretations of the purpose of the initiative and tactics
   intended to achieve it. In this paper, I employ two concepts: TECHNOLOGY
   FRAMES and the ORDER OF CHANGE MAGNITUDE surrounding technology change.
   By understanding the meanings that various stakeholder groups attach to
   the same communications about the change initiative, we may better
   understand the characteristic ways in which they interpret both the
   objectives of the change initiative and how it will be implemented. By
   using these concepts to explain various stakeholders' conflicting
   interpretations of the information that they have received about the
   change initiative, this paper shows how they perceive differently what
   events constitute progress toward achieving the initiative's objectives.},

Abstract = {We define user participation as the extent to which users or their
   representatives carry out assignments and perform various activities and
   behaviors during the system development process {[}1], {[}2]. This work
   has identified three dimensions of USER PARTICIPATION: responsibility,
   user-IS relationship, and hands-on activity, However, this
   three-dimensional view of user participation does not capture an
   important aspect of participation, communication between users and with
   various stakeholders. This paper replicates and extends past research by
   proposing the addition of a fourth dimension, COMMUNICATION ACTIVITY.
   Data collected from 324 users drawn from 162 IS development teams were
   used to replicate our three dimensions and to examine evidence for the
   construct validity of the new dimension. Consistent with expectations,
   strong evidence was found suggesting that communication activity needs
   to be considered a fourth dimension of user participation.},

Abstract = {This study explores factors affecting the implementation of intranets,
   which are the technology upon which many knowledge management (KM)
   systems are built. Because intranets facilitate sharing of employee
   knowledge. many believe that organizational culture will influence
   intranet implementation. The results of this study found that intranet
   implementation is facilitated by a culture that emphasizes an atmosphere
   of trust and concern for other people (ethical culture), flexibility and
   innovation (developmental culture), and policies, procedures, and
   information management (hierarchical culture). Management should ensure
   that the proper values are in place to optimize intranet implementation
   and facilitate knowledge sharing.},

Abstract = {Background: Communication is critical to engineering work, and despite
   its emphasis within engineering education, it is still noted as a gap in
   new engineers' preparedness for work. Literature review: Prior research
   points to communication gaps among new engineers. Few studies have
   extensively examined transitions between academic and professional
   engineering contexts. Work remains for understanding how new engineers
   transfer communication skills. Research questions: 1. In what ways do
   new engineers transfer communication practices from school to work? 2.
   What challenges do new engineers experience in moving from communication
   as practiced at school to communication as practiced at work? Research
   methodology: This study presents a thematic analysis of data from weekly
   reflections and regular semistructured interviews conducted during new
   engineers' first year of work. Results and conclusions: Despite relying
   heavily on academic experiences involving both documenting and
   presenting technical work, new engineers report experiencing
   communication-related challenges. While further attention to
   communication activities can be given within engineering curricula, the
   complexity and situated nature of communication in the workplace cannot
   be fully replicated in the classroom. As new engineers move between
   school and work, they experience challenges adapting to a new
   environment including communication activities embedded within unique
   sociocultural contexts. While the classroom cannot fully replicate these
   professional settings and all of their nuances, students can be made
   more fully aware of the embedded nature of communication activities.
   Moreover, engineering educators can simulate aspects of the workplace in
   capstone courses, and companies can provide guidance to help mentor new
   engineers through the inevitable context gaps.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Studies how one entrepreneur acquired, applied, and
   fit frames to her startup venture and stakeholders over one year.
   Research questions: How do pitchers acquire frames for pitches? How do
   pitchers apply frames to existing pitches? How do pitchers gauge the fit
   between the innovation, frames, and stakeholders? Literature review: The
   literature examined-framing professional communication, developing
   pitches, and framing pitches-stresses the relationship between framing,
   agency, and deliberation. However, few studies approach data from the
   perspective of the pitcher and few frames outside of the
   problem-solution frame are considered. Methodology: This autoethnography
   analyzes data from more than 500 pages of field notes, 60 minutes of
   video-recorded pitch sessions, 25 interviews with pitch stakeholders,
   and various textual artifacts that pertained to Author 1's nonprofit
   startup organization, Hacker Gals. Themes in the data were identified
   and analyzed through the composition of analytic memos. Frames were
   identified and analyzed through close reading and holistic
   interpretation. Results and conclusions: The entrepreneur acquired the
   most influential frames through stakeholder discussion, applied these
   frames in a way that stacked and made salient multiple frames beyond the
   problem-solution frame, and judged frame fit by considering the degree
   to which catchers took up the frames. The study's results suggest that
   the practice of frame stacking might increase pitch effectiveness by
   mitigating troubled identifications.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Subgroup formation in global virtual teams could
   negatively impact team performance due to difficulties in coordination,
   trust, and team cohesion. Research questions: What role do trust and
   team cohesion play in the relationship between coordination
   effectiveness and team performance of global virtual teams with two
   distinct subgroups? Literature review: Prior research suggests that
   coordination effectiveness on team performance is most strongly impacted
   by coordination of knowledge. This effectiveness is mediated by trust
   and team cohesion. However, we have a poor understanding of trust and
   team cohesion dynamics on intergroup relationships in global virtual
   teams. Methodology: A survey was conducted with 14 teams with a total of
   112 participants in the US and India. The teams were tasked with
   evaluating customer-relationship-management best practices for a global
   environment. Results and discussion: We evaluated how the process of
   effective coordination for teams composed of two colocated subgroups is
   mediated by individual perceptions of out-group trust and overall team
   cohesion. Our findings show that individual trust and team cohesion
   share a reciprocal impact on each other, suggesting that effective
   coordination in virtual teams can create a positive feedback loop with
   trust and cohesion, improving overall project performance. Implications
   for theory and practice include the virtuous cycle that trust and
   cohesion create in global virtual team coordination and the necessity of
   establishing appropriate project coordination systems and processes to
   promote both aspects and, thus, achieve excellent project performance
   for colocated subgroups.},

Abstract = {Research problem: This study investigates the phenomenon of
   user-generated content strategy in an open-source, wiki-based
   content-management system (CMS) for the repair of technological devices
   (http://ifixit.com). By ``user-generated content strategy,{''} we mean
   processes for developing systems for producing, moderating, and
   encouraging user-generated content. Research questions: (1) What
   strategies, or holistic means of organizing content, are used to manage
   repair manual content via an open-source, wiki-based content-management
   system that relies on content generated by a wide variety of users? (2)
   What content rules, or logical premises for how and where content is
   developed, emerge from a qualitative case study of such a CMS?
   Literature review: Though a wealth of empirical research has been
   conducted into user-generated content, few studies have focused on the
   explicit strategies employed by organizations to develop and encourage
   such content. At the same time, several recent calls by researchers in
   both academia and industry have indicated a need for such content
   models. Some of the challenges these thinkers have noted with creating
   user-generated content strategies include the difficulty of maintaining
   a consistent strategy across content generated by users who don't
   necessarily understand what strategies are in place, as well as
   maintaining a modicum of quality assurance without squelching user
   participation. Methodology: We conducted a content audit of iFixit's
   main educational initiative, the Technical Writing Project
   (http://edu.ifixit.com) to identify strategies iFixit uses to organize
   content in this initiative. iFixit is an open-source wiki to help users
   repair their own devices. We supplemented the audit with interviews with
   student participants in the project and iFixit technical writing staff
   to find out what technologies and other affordances affected users of
   the iFixit Technical Writing Project. Results and conclusions: The main
   user-generated content strategies used by iFixit include allowing users
   a wide range of means to participate (such as posting comments or
   developing their own repair guides), using a content moderation queue
   (or simple interface for seeing all updates to the wiki), ensuring
   quality assurance of all repair guide content through redundancy (such
   as making sure experienced users vetted every published guide), and
   staging (or arranging information in a linear sequence) information in a
   multimodal fashion (using multiple modes of communication to reinforce
   the same information). Such strategies represent a commitment by iFixit
   to opening up practices that are central to creating content, such as
   repair documentation, to any interested internet user. Lessons for
   organizations who wish to encourage user-generated content include
   developing strategies that protect users from the worst consequences of
   their actions, that encourage participation, and that allow for
   experienced users to vet new content.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The question: How Korean entrepreneurs in an
   entrepreneurship program revised their slide decks for their
   presentations ({''}pitches{''}) in response to professional
   communication genres representing feedback from potential stakeholders
   in their target markets is examined. Research questions: As
   entrepreneurs learn to pitch ideas to unfamiliar markets, how do they
   revise their slide decks for their pitches when interacting with other
   professional communication genres that represent the concerns of market
   stakeholders? Specifically, what changes do entrepreneurs make to the
   claims, evidence, and complexity of arguments in their pitches?
   Literature review: The professional communication literature
   demonstrates that the revision process tends to take place in
   documentation cycles where documents are set in interaction with each
   other. Yet such revision processes are not studied in detail in existing
   studies of entrepreneurial pitches in marketing and technology
   commercialization. Methodology: In this exploratory qualitative study,
   researchers textually analyzed 14 sets of five related document genres
   in the archives of an entrepreneurship program. These genres represented
   a full cycle of activity: application to the program, initial pitches,
   initial feedback from program personnel, detailed feedback from
   representative stakeholders in the target market, and revised pitches.
   Interviews and surveys of program personnel further contextualize the
   data. Results and conclusions: Entrepreneurs revised their claims and
   evidence based on their dialogue with their target market. Some of the
   entrepreneurs altered their slides to make more complex arguments
   rebutting stakeholders' concerns. These findings suggest that
   entrepreneurs engage in dialogue with their target markets, but their
   engagement tends to be guided by tacit, situated experience rather than
   through an explicit, systematized approach.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Many Asian universities have begun reforms to enhance
   educational competitiveness in our globalizing economy. This study aims
   to ascertain the status of English communication education and
   English-medium instruction at a Korean engineering school and to offer
   workable suggestions for English communication training for Korean
   graduate engineering students. Research questions: Should English
   communication education be offered at the graduate level in Korean
   engineering schools? How could English communication education be
   improved for Korean graduate engineering students? Literature review:
   Studies of English communication education for graduate engineering
   students indicate that English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students have
   English needs to publish internationally and English needs for
   English-medium instruction classes and for after graduation.
   Furthermore, individual assistance and e-learning programs might
   strengthen English communication education and academic writing for EFL
   graduate engineering students. Methodology: An evaluation study was
   conducted at an institution that has been leading the wave of English as
   the language of instruction. We collected data from documents as well as
   through surveys of faculty and students in graduate engineering
   programs. Results and discussion: The study was conducted at the Korea
   Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The results showed that
   students' English fluency is critical for the success of using English
   as a medium of instruction. To facilitate this fluency, universities
   need to establish an English communication center that provides a
   comprehensive, systematic approach to English language training. Faculty
   also need the services of such centers. It is also advised that a thesis
   writing course be customized according to students' actual writing and
   communication abilities and enhanced with collaboration between
   engineering faculty and English education faculty.},

Title = {The Role of National Culture and Multimedia on First Impression Bias
   Reduction: An Experimental Study in US and China},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of the study was to explore the effects of
   national culture and medium type on first impression bias reduction in
   the context of job interview and performance appraisals. Research
   questions: (1) Does the evaluators' national culture affect first
   impression bias reduction? (2) Which medium type (text or multimedia) is
   more effective in reducing first impression bias? and (3) Does medium
   effect in reducing first impression bias vary with national culture?
   Literature review: The purpose of the literature review is to examine
   the current literature in the areas of national culture, medium type and
   first impression bias reduction, especially in a communication context.
   Researchers reviewed the discussions on first impression formation, and
   national culture theories, and the Media Richness Theory. For media,
   multimedia type was found to reduce first impression bias more than text
   medium type. For national culture, the literature review suggested that
   national culture dimensions (such as collectivism, assertiveness, and
   uncertainty avoidance) could possibly affect first impression bias
   reduction. Methodology: The researchers conducted a quantitative
   experiment with 407 students from a US university and a Chinese
   university, who majored in business-related disciplines. Researchers
   requested the treatment group participants to access performance bias
   cue. The participants then performed an initial appraisal of a manager
   based on Denison's leadership index. The participants then viewed the
   job interview of the manager, via different media, and performed the
   appraisal again. The performance appraisal data were collected via a
   website. The researchers used Analysis of Variance to analyze the data.
   Results and discussion: This study found that for our participants,
   national culture reduces first impression bias more than media. It
   identified that first impression bias reduction in US participants is
   significantly greater than that in Chinese participants, independent of
   media used. Regardless of national culture of media users, this study
   found that users using text medium were able to reduce first impression
   bias significantly more than users using multimedia. The implications of
   this study are that to reduce first impression bias in cross-cultural
   settings, managers and employees must adapt the channels and effort
   allocation for communication to national culture. Managers and
   researchers must understand that national culture is more important than
   media in reducing first impression bias. The limitations of the study
   were the use of student participants, and absence of national culture
   dimensions measurement. The study was conducted in only two national
   cultures. Future research could use employees as participants, measure
   national culture dimensions, and replicate the study in various national
   cultures.},

Abstract = {It is evolutionarily adaptive for humans to have enhanced memories of
   events surrounding surprise situations, because in our ancestral past
   surprise situations were often associated with survival threats. Vividly
   remembering memories immediately before and after a snake attack,for
   example, allowed our hominid ancestors to be better prepared to avoid
   and deal with future attacks, which in turn enhanced their chances of
   survival. This study shows that such enhanced memorization capacity
   likely endowed on us by evolution can be exploited for knowledge
   communication through computer interfaces. A knowledge communication
   experiment was conducted in which subjects were asked to review
   web-based learning modules about International Commercial Terms
   (Incoterms), and then take a test on what they had learned. Data from
   six learning modules in two experimental conditions were contrasted. In
   the treatment condition, a web-based screen with a shake picture in
   attack position, displayed together with a hissing background noise, was
   used to create a simulated threat that surprised the subjects. In the
   control condition the simulated threat was absent. As expected, based on
   the evolutionary psychological view that surprise can enhance learning,
   the subjects in the treatment condition (i.e., with the snake screen)
   did approximately 28\% better than those in the control condition (i.e.,
   without the snake screen) at learning about Incoterms. This improvement
   occurred only for the two web-based modules immediately before and after
   the snake screen. Those two modules comprise what is referred to in this
   study as the surprise zone. There were no significant differences in
   learning performance between the two experimental conditions for modules
   outside the surprise zone.},

Abstract = {After the controversial police shooting of a developmentally-disabled
   African-American teenager in July 2003, the new mayor of Denver, CO,
   appointed a politically diverse task force to revise the police
   department's use-of force policy and propose a new model for police
   oversight. This teaching case is based on the task force's deliberations
   and collaborative efforts to build policy consensus in a sometimes
   rancorous, high-stakes environment. In it, I reconstruct the story of
   the shooting that gave rise to the task force, trace the arc of the task
   force's 104-day existence, and analyze the letter and final report
   submitted by the task force's co-chairs to (1) demonstrate the
   highly-pressurized nature of policy language invention and the crucial
   impact of word choice in such policy, and (2) illustrate the difficulty
   the task force encountered in attempting to secure consensus and the
   manner in which the final work product acknowledges, rather than
   obscures, this struggle. Finally, the case includes recommended readings
   and a guide for individual and group activities for implementation in
   either an undergraduate- or graduate-level technical communication
   course.},

Abstract = {This study explores methodological issues that communication scholars
   and practitioners face when administering electronic surveys within
   for-profit organizations. In 2000, the researchers conducted a series of
   three cross-sectional studies within General Electric's (GE) Global
   Research Center. The Center is located in Niskayuna, NY. An equivalent
   version of a communication survey was administered electronically to a
   random stratified sample of GE employees three times that year. Each
   employee sample was subject to a different survey intervention: no
   intervention, follow-up reminder email only, and leader pre-announcement
   email plus a follow-up reminder. The researchers also recorded how long
   it took respondents to return their surveys. The highest response rate
   (41\%) occurred in the third intervention. Across the three
   administrations, 465 GE employees completed the surveys; 98\% of
   respondents returned their surveys electronically rather than printing
   out their responses and sending them to the researcher by postal mail.
   The article concludes with implications and suggestions for those who
   administer electronic surveys within organizations.},

Abstract = {While a significant amount of attention and interest has been directed
   to investigate the communicative functions of organizational websites,
   little research has been done to examine how internal organizational
   communication shapes organizational website design. This study employs
   the theory of rhetorical situation to examine the impact of internal
   organizational communication on website design. Specifically, it has
   examined a few organizational website design case studies from the
   perspective of rhetorical situation and has analyzed a case about
   website design by a Chinese student organization on a US college campus.
   Both the examination and analysis show that organizations and designers
   must communicate effectively in the process of identifying and
   thereafter transforming organizational objectives into effective website
   features. Both theoretical and practical implications for organizational
   website design are addressed in the paper.},

Abstract = {Geospatio-temporal conceptual models provide a mechanism to explicitly
   represent geospatial and temporal aspects of applications. Such models,
   which focus on both ``what{''} and ``when/where,{''} need to be more
   expressive than conventional conceptual models (e.g., the ER model),
   which primarily focus on what{''} is important for a given application.
   In this study, we view conceptual schema comprehension of
   geospatio-temporal data semantics in terms of matching the external
   problem representation (that is, the conceptual schema) to the
   problem-solving task (that is, syntactic and semantic comprehension
   tasks), an argument based on the theory of cognitive fit. Our theory
   suggests that an external problem representation that matches the
   problem solver's internal task representation will enhance performance,
   for example, in comprehending such schemas. To assess performance on
   geospatio-temporal schema comprehension tasks, we conducted a laboratory
   experiment using two semantically identical conceptual schemas, one of
   which mapped closely to the internal task representation while the other
   did not. As expected, we found that the geospatio-temporal conceptual
   schema that corresponded to the internal representation of the task
   enhanced the accuracy of schema comprehension; comprehension time was
   equivalent for both. Cognitive fit between the internal representation
   of the task and conceptual schemas with geospatio-temporal annotations
   was, therefore, manifested in accuracy of schema comprehension and not
   in time for problem solution. Our findings suggest that the annotated
   schemas facilitate understanding of data semantics represented on the
   schema.},

Title = {``The Basis of Aaaalll of Our Program!{''} The Start-Up Chile Playbook
   as Metagenre},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 17},
Abstract = {Background: Following previous professional communication research into
   entrepreneurship, we examine key genres of a specific business
   accelerator, Start-Up Chile (SUP). Through a triangulated study of
   interviews, texts, and videos, we examine how the Playbook serves as a
   regulatory metagenre that represents the SUP experience to the
   participating firms. We find that aspects of the Playbook's
   representation are at odds with the other data, divergences that we
   argue emerge from a broader tension among SUP's stakeholders and goals.
   Literature review: We review the professional communication literature
   on entrepreneurship, literature on startups and accelerators, and on
   writing, activity, and genre research (WAGR). Specifically, we examine
   WAGR research on metagenres and professional identity formation.
   Research question: How does this successful international accelerator
   regularize the learning experience of its exceedingly diverse startups?
   Specifically, how does SUP regulate the startups' different experiences,
   reframing the experience of entrepreneurship and teaching these startups
   to form their professional identity as entrepreneurs? Research
   methodology: We structured this research as a qualitative case study of
   SUP. Data included documents, videos, interviews, and social media. We
   triangulated these data sources to identify points of convergence (in
   which different data sources supported the same assertions) and
   divergence (in which data sources contradicted each other). Results: SUP
   provides the Playbook and Newsletter as metagenres that regulate complex
   interactions among other genres and events, guiding firms into having
   roughly equivalent experiences as well as maintaining relationships
   among volunteers such as mentors. But the Playbook also reframes the
   experience of entrepreneurship so that it can fit into SUP's program: it
   reframes the cyclical entrepreneurship process as linear, and it
   reframes promises of future action as tracking of past actions. In
   undergoing these experiences, the startups form their professional
   identity as entrepreneurs. Conclusion: We conclude by discussing
   implications for accelerators as well as for how professional
   communication genres and metagenres regulate neophytes' experiences in
   training programs more broadly.},

Title = {How Technology Support for Contextualization Affects Enterprise Social
   Media Use: A Media System Dependency Perspective},

Abstract = {Research background: Using enterprise social media (ESM) in the
   workplace has become an important channel for initiating communication
   activities for employees in the organization. However, some
   organizations reported that they did not obtain expected returns from
   their ESM investments. This outcome may be attributed to employee
   underutilization of ESM. Thus, exploring how employees use ESM is vital
   to improving communication efficiency. Research questions: 1. How does
   ESM support for contextualization affect employees' dependency relations
   with ESM? 2. How do dependency relations affect ESM use? Literature
   review: For professional communicators and other workers, dependency
   relations can enhance their media use behavior by channeling more useful
   information. In studying how professional communicators use a medium,
   researchers indicated that users' continuance intention rarely occurs
   without users' dependency on the medium, thus making media system
   dependency (MSD) relations critical for media use. Based on the MSD
   theory, we investigate how ESM support for cognitive and affective
   contextualization affects employees' understanding, orientation, and
   play dependency relations with ESM, and consequently affect work-related
   and social ESM uses. Methodology: We surveyed 258 employees of a large
   software development firm in China. Results and conclusions: Our
   findings suggest that technical and professional communicators who have
   not yet used ESM in their work may take the following steps: 1. explore
   ESM and their specific use by employees; 2. manage and control different
   information sharing among employees on ESM so as to satisfy employees'
   different goals; and 3. design and develop different ESM
   functionalities.},

Title = {A Matter of Perspective: A Discursive Analysis of the Perceptions of
   Three Stakeholders of the Mutianyu Great Wall},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the different and competing perspectives
   of stakeholders of cultural heritage sites by examining the Mutianyu
   Great Wall in China. Literature review: Most studies focus on
   investigating the tourism destination image from the perspective of only
   one stakeholder, and only a small amount of research has attempted to
   integrate the perspectives of competing stakeholders into a single
   study. Research questions: 1. How did the business operator perceive the
   Mutianyu Great Wall? 2. How did UNESCO perceive the Mutianyu Great Wall?
   3. How did international tourists on TripAdvisor perceive the Mutianyu
   Great Wall? 4. What are the dynamics among the three stakeholders'
   perceptions? 5. In those dynamics, what are the contested issues in the
   Great Wall's heritage preservation and tourism development? Methodology:
   The study adopts a discursive approach to social constructivism in
   examining the images of the site as perceived by the three important
   stakeholders. It incorporates qualitative thematic and multimodal
   discourse analysis with quantitative high-frequency word analysis,
   supplemented by an interview with the heritage site administrator and a
   field trip. Results: The business operator perceived the Mutianyu Great
   Wall as a scenic spot for modern rural tourism, UNESCO emphasized its
   historical and cultural significance, and international tourists
   perceived it as a hybrid image. Conclusions: The study identified a
   preservation-growth continuum and showed different and even competing
   perspectives. It also discussed two contested issues in the field. The
   study contributes to heritage studies by developing an interdisciplinary
   discursive framework and suggests practical implications to heritage
   management and professional communication.},

Title = {Communicating Entrepreneurial Passion: Personal Passion vs. Perceived
   Passion in Venture Pitches},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-378},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research problem: Entrepreneurial passion has been shown to play an
   important role in venture success and, therefore, in investors' funding
   decisions. However, it is unknown whether the passion entrepreneurs
   personally feel or experience can be accurately assessed by investors
   during a venture pitch. Research questions: (1) To what extent does
   entrepreneurs' personal passion align with investors' perceived passion?
   (2) To what cues do investors attend when assessing entrepreneurs'
   passion? Literature review: Integrating theory and research in
   entrepreneurship communication and entrepreneurial passion within the
   context of venture pitching, we explain that during venture pitches,
   investors make judgments about entrepreneurs' passion that have
   consequences for their investment decisions. However, they can attend to
   only those cues that entrepreneurs outwardly display. As a result, they
   may not be assessing the passion entrepreneurs personally feel or
   experience. Methodology: We used a sequential explanatory mixed methods
   research design. For our data collection, we surveyed 40 student
   entrepreneurs, videorecorded their venture pitches, and facilitated
   focus groups with 16 investors who viewed the videos and ranked, rated,
   and discussed their perceptions of entrepreneurs' passion. We conducted
   statistical analyses to assess the extent to which entrepreneurs'
   personal passion and investors' perceived passion aligned. We then
   performed an inductive analysis of critical cases to identify specific
   cues that investors attributed to passion or lack thereof. Results and
   conclusions: We revealed a large misalignment between entrepreneurs'
   personal passion and investors' perceived passion. Our critical case
   analysis demonstrated that entrepreneurs' weak or strong presentation
   skills led investors either to underestimate or overestimate,
   respectively, perceptions of entrepreneurs' passion. We suggest that
   entrepreneurs should develop specific presentation skills and rhetorical
   strategies for displaying their passion; at the same time, investors
   should be wary of attending too closely to presentation skills when
   assessing passion.},

Title = {Social Media and Multinational Corporations' Corporate Social
   Responsibility in China: The Case of ConocoPhillips Oil Spill Incident},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-153},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research problem: The study attempts to study how an empowered Chinese
   public coped with and interpreted the environmental crisis of the
   ConocoPhillips oil spill and how ConocoPhillips reacted to the growing
   influence of social media. Research questions: In what ways did the
   Chinese public exercise its new power through social media in addressing
   the ConocoPhillips Oil Spill Incident? How did a multinational company
   like ConocoPhillips act during the crisis and react to the voices of the
   public through new media? Literature review: Social media has caused a
   power shift in China by allowing the ordinary Chinese public who used to
   be the silent majority to expose scandals and express their opinions
   about crises with greater freedom. At the same time, pressure is growing
   on corporations to exercise social responsibility, through responding to
   economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary expectations that society
   has. Stakeholder theory indicates that only by meeting the needs and
   expectations of the individuals and groups who can affect or are
   affected by the firm's objectives can a firm survive and succeed. In
   developing countries, corporate social responsibility is characterized
   by a lack of systematic and institutionalized approach, with
   stakeholders, such as the public and community, being neglected for a
   long time. Methodology: Researchers conducted a thematic analysis of 932
   microblog and blog entries about the ConocoPhillips Oil Spill Incident
   in China that were published on leading Chinese social media websites
   between June 2011 to February 2013. Results and discussion: The study
   found that the oil spill sparked an uproar of anger and criticism in the
   Chinese online community. Most posts on microblogs and blogs engaged in
   finding the causes and laying the blame for the oil spill. The
   overwhelming majority of the Chinese public attributed the crisis to the
   faulty laws and inaction on the part of the Chinese government
   regulators, to ConocoPhillips, and the Chinese joint venture partner
   China National Offshore Oil Corporation's failure to undertake due
   responsibilities. In response to mounting online criticisms,
   ConocoPhillips exhibited little interest in engaging with the Chinese
   public and showed poor communication in terms of Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR). The study's theoretical contribution lies in
   combining CSR and Stakeholder theory with Discourse Power theory.
   Practical implications to multinational corporations seeking long-term
   business development in the developing country contexts, such as China,
   are that managers need to engage in responsive listening, actively
   participate in online conversations, and constantly scan the social
   media environment to manage its relations with the general public.
   Particularly, firms experiencing crises can gain the public's emotional
   support by communicating emotion-laden messages through social media.},

Abstract = {This study explores a comprehensive sample of experimental and
   quasi-experimental research within five leading technical communication
   journals over a 20-year period. Exploratory studies can overview how a
   method has evolved within a field, highlighting how it has advanced
   understanding of communication and identifying areas for further
   inquiry. Research questions: (1) How has experimental research in
   technical communication journals developed over the 20-year period?
   Specifically, how much is being published, which journals publish
   experiments, what topics are being explored, and what fields are
   informing this research? (2) What content characterizes experimental
   research in technical communication? Specifically, how explicit are the
   research questions/hypotheses, are the results of pilot studies
   reported, what are the sample sizes and populations used, and what
   measures do researchers use? (3) Who publishes experimental research in
   technical communication? Specifically, which authors and affiliates are
   most associated with experimental research, and how does the sample's
   gender and authorship distribution compare to existing research?
   Literature review: We first address how scholars have assessed research
   in technical communication and how these findings implicate experimental
   research. We then review features of other exploratory studies that
   inform this study's design. Methodology: We conducted a quantitative and
   qualitative analysis of 137 experiments, a comprehensive sample
   identified from a corpus of 2,118 refereed papers published from 1992 to
   2011. We coded 14 variables related to the causal relationships that the
   experiments addressed and who produced the research. We subjected the
   data to multiple statistical measures, including contingency table
   analysis and correspondence analysis. Results and conclusions: Over the
   20 years, the journals published experimental research at a consistent
   rate. This could indicate that these methods have a stable presence in
   the field, or a discouraging sign that output is not on the rise despite
   calls from leading scholars. (TPC) emerged as a strong producer of
   experiments, publishing 45\% of the sample. TPC was also associated with
   most recent experiments, assuming this role from, which was associated
   with early experiments. In addition, TPC,, and correlated with
   experiments on collaboration, pedagogy, and intercultural communication,
   respectively. The results also revealed that recent experiments reported
   significantly more explicit research question/hypotheses and pilot
   studies, an encouraging sign for the quality of future experiments.
   Finally, Spyridakis published the most experiments over the past 20
   years, and researchers at the University of Washington and the
   University of Twente were the top affiliates associated with output. The
   configuration of both of these institutions' programs, which seem to
   align with a traditional science model, might suggest how the evolution
   of technical communication programs impacts the type of research that
   its affiliates produce. Our results are limited by the small, though
   comprehensive, sample and the exploratory natures of measures like
   correspondence analysis. Future research could use the proposed
   framework to investigate the evolution of other research methods in
   technical communication, strengthening our body of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Research Problem: There are no prior studies comparing modes of
   communication for virtual teams working over a substantial period of
   time that combined an initial synchronous desktop audio or video meeting
   with subsequent text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC).
   Research Questions: Does the initial medium condition impact
   decision-making quality, creativity, group development, and process
   satisfaction? Literature Review: Previous literature on media richness
   (the ability of a medium to carry and reproduce information based on
   feedback, multiple cues, language variety, and personal focus) and group
   outcomes (the level of creativity and quality of the work delivered by
   the group) suggests that ad-hoc groups using asynchronous CMC alone
   (without any initial meeting) or asynchronous CMC combined with an
   initial face-to-face (FTF) meeting have significantly higher levels of
   creativity and decision quality, compared to single-mode synchronous CMC
   groups or FTF groups. Methodology: In this study, a laboratory
   experiment was conducted with 136 participants from 14 countries. All
   teams used asynchronous CMC for two weeks for a software requirements
   task, following an initial synchronous meeting in one of four
   conditions: FTF, desktop audioconferencing, desktop videoconferencing,
   or text only. Results and Discussion: Results suggest that there are no
   significant differences among the four conditions. This research
   indicates that it does not matter what medium is used for an initial
   short meeting of a group that is to subsequently work together via
   asynchronous text communication.},

Abstract = {Research Problem: Claims have been made about the impact of applying
   Linguistic Politeness Theory to workplace contexts. Linguistic
   politeness theory argues that speakers or senders of messages make
   language choices to soften potential face-threatening acts. These claims
   have not been empirically examined in regards to trust between leaders
   and members. Research Questions: (1) What effect does a leader's use of
   linguistic politeness have on perceptions of trust? (2) Do indirect and
   direct requests differ in building trust? (3) Is there an optimal
   combination of level of directness and type of linguistic politeness
   strategy in building trust? Literature Review: Previous literature has
   shown that people in positions of power utilize linguistic politeness
   when interacting with subordinates. Further, studies have shown an
   association between managerial communication style and relational
   variables, including trust. No study, however, has empirically examined
   a leader's use of linguistic politeness on subordinate's perceptions of
   trust toward the leader. Methodology: The current study uses a
   quantitative approach. An experiment was designed to test the effect of
   politeness on trust. One-hundred fifteen undergraduates were selected
   for the experiment. Results and Discussion: Quantitative analysis, which
   included a two-way ANOVA, revealed that participants trusted leaders who
   used linguistic politeness strategies in their emails, as opposed to
   those who failed to include mitigating strategies. Furthermore,
   downgraders, moves that mitigate the force of face-threatening act
   without adding semantic content, were effective at building trust when
   paired with direct speech acts. Similarly, supportive moves, moves that
   mitigate face-threatening acts but do add semantic content, were
   effective at building trust when paired with indirect speech acts. The
   results have theoretical implications that include the contextual
   importance of linguistic politeness strategies. Further, practical
   implications include the way student leaders might phrase email requests
   to team members. However, because the sample included students, the
   results must be carefully interpreted, particularly when extrapolating
   to professional populations. Future studies can apply a similar
   methodology to a population of professionals, allowing for a comparison
   of datasets.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have often highlighted macro factors as explaining the
   adoption and use of cell phones in developing economies. However, micro
   factors, which directly affect the end user's motivations, have been
   underinvestigated. We examine the influence of micro factors on both
   individuals' attitude toward and their use of cell phones. Data were
   collected through a survey of 463 cell-phone users in Guinea. Results
   show that mobility, familiarity, social influence, and resources
   possession influence the attitude toward and the use of cellular
   telephones. In contrast, the hypothesis that subscription conditions are
   the main influence on cell-phone use is not verified.},

Abstract = {This tutorial explains and describes the use of several microformats,
   which make information marked up in HTML available for use in
   applications outside traditional web browsers. Because microformats
   consist of minor additions to the HTML backbone of common webpages, they
   represent a simple but significant move toward what Tim Berners-Lee has
   called the ``Semantic Web{''}-but without requiring the technical and
   practical shifts and time demands of a complete XML-based
   semantic-web-development approach. Microformats also provide technical
   communicators with literacies and a conceptual foundation to approach
   more advanced Semantic Web technologies and suggest ways to refine
   current web design practice.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-68},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Virtual teams-face challenges arising from geographical distance,
   cultural differences, and differing modes of interaction. Team leaders
   in particular face these challenges because they are primarily
   responsible for efficient team management. Technology choices made by
   leaders have become a focus of interest in communication studies, but
   questions regarding media choice in virtual teams have not been widely
   studied. This article describes an in-depth, ethnographic exploration of
   Finnish virtual team leaders who work in natural teams in organizational
   contexts. The principal goal was to examine their choice of
   communication technologies in daily work. The results indicate that the
   choice was based on four factors. First, there are two factors that are
   person-related: Accessibility and social distance. Accessibility refers
   to people's ease of access through a particular medium, and social
   distance suggests that the technology selection is based on the social
   distance between the persons involved. Second, there are two
   task-related factors: idea sharing and informing. These factors describe
   team leaders' media selection by the nature of the task at hand, The
   findings suggest that team leaders' technology choice can be partly
   explained by traditional media selection theories, but in virtual
   contexts, accessibility becomes an important determinant of which
   technology is chosen.},

Abstract = {This paper argues for using specialized collaborative writing (CW) tools
   to improve the results of distributed, internet-based writing teams. The
   key features of collaborative tools that support enhanced coordination
   and group awareness are compared to existing writing tools. The first
   internet-based CW tool, Collaboratus, is introduced, and its group
   features are compared with those of Microsoft Word. Next, theoretical
   propositions, hypotheses, and constructs are formulated to predict
   outcomes of distributed groups that use CW tools. A four-week-long
   synchronous-distributed experiment then compares the outcomes of
   Collaboratus and Word groups. Innovative measures show that Collaboratus
   groups generally experience better outcomes than Word groups, in terms
   of productivity, document quality, relationships, and communication, but
   not in terms of satisfaction. The results buttress the conclusion that
   internet-based CW teams can benefit from specialized collaborative
   technologies that provide enhanced coordination, group awareness, and CW
   activity support.},

Abstract = {Background: Fluent and accurate speaking is an essential set of skills
   that engineering students strive to achieve, as they can lead to better
   job placement and a promising future. This article documents a speaking
   assessment carried out among 120 engineering students who have undergone
   two semesters of Technical English courses in the final year of their
   study. The students from diverse departments opted for the English for
   Competitive Exams elective course to improve their English language
   proficiency. The objective of the elective is to train the learners in
   essential language components for facing high-stakes competitive exams
   with an integrated language skills approach. Literature review: This
   linguistics-focused study documents a cluster strategy, a pedagogical
   attempt at speaking, with a culminating self-reflection phase. The
   strategy cluster was thoughtfully designed and integrated throughout the
   semester to enhance the students' speaking competency. Research
   questions: 1. How do learners perceive the effectiveness of speaking
   skills practice given to them in the online sessions? 2. What benefits
   through feedback have learners achieved during these sessions? 3. How do
   students perceive the role of self-directed efforts toward improving
   their speaking skills? Methods: Students were trained on speaking skills
   as part of a semester-long online course, and an assessment for speaking
   skills was designed in which students answered 10 self-reflective
   questions about their perception and usefulness of practice, feedback
   from the instructor and peers, and self-directed efforts. Each student's
   recorded audio file of an average of 11 minutes 24 seconds was uploaded
   to the learning management system (LMS) as part of the assessment. A
   qualitative and interpretative investigation of their answers reflecting
   their learning experiences during the semester, based on the activities
   and self-regulation, and their self-rating were analyzed thematically.
   Results and discussion: The findings of the metainvestigation show
   significantly valuable insights with potential implications on the
   language teachers' perception of teaching speaking skills in the
   classroom, especially in the current online environment. Conclusions: We
   conclude that using the strategy cluster comprising practice, feedback,
   and self-directed efforts with a culminating phase of oral
   self-reflection is highly beneficial in developing speaking skills in
   engineering courses focusing on technical communication.},

Abstract = {Background: Under the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, law
   enforcement agencies are required to draft and uphold a Use of Force
   document to safeguard the rights of the public. This document, in its
   most successful form, defines use of force and offers specific core
   principles that outline de-escalation tactics and techniques to
   reinforce use of force and deadly force as a last resort. What is
   missing from the conversation of this policy is an analysis of the
   rhetorical choices within each document, and the understanding that
   these documents are rarely written with social justice in mind; rather,
   they are focused on legalese and protecting the individual departments
   and the police officer responsible for using force. Literature review:
   The Use of Force document is a genre of policy that academics have been
   drawn to, especially in consideration of social justice. With a rise in
   law enforcement violent interactions with historically marginalized
   groups of the public, policy analysis is necessary. Research questions:
   1. What key terms, concepts, and narratives are used within each
   document to reinforce oppressive ideology? 2. What rhetorical moves give
   agency of force to officers through various terminology? 3. What does an
   analysis of these policy documents reveal for technical and professional
   communicators regarding our role in social-justice-driven work? Research
   methods: I performed a rhetorical analysis of each document, pinpointing
   words, phrases, and sections that were unique to the specific text.
   NVivo qualitative research software was used to create word trees, where
   word frequencies were analyzed to uncover each department's situational
   position and the implication of such. Results and discussion: The
   analysis revealed that of the two documents under review, one tended to
   humanize not only the situational officer, who is incapable of being
   neutral, and the person whom force is being used against. The other
   tended to reflect policy-driven terminology that works to dehumanize the
   person involved with the officer and continues to uphold oppressive
   rhetoric. Conclusion: Technical communicators have a responsibility to
   insert themselves in issues of injustice. An analysis of these policy
   documents reveals areas of revision, areas where the public should be
   involved, and is a move toward further accountability regarding police
   brutality against historically marginalized communities.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Accessibility training frequently relies upon
   checklist-based approaches to convey important standards and guidance.
   Such approaches limit scalability and acknowledgement of the user
   experience. About the case: A certificate program for faculty and
   graduate teaching assistants who are instructors of record at one
   university provided an opportunity to develop a learning module about
   dyslexia. Situating the case: Dyslexic students frequently require
   alterations to both teaching approaches and document design; however,
   studies show that some faculty do not see or feel a need to offer any
   accommodations for this dis/ability. Research indicates that
   train-the-trainer approaches to accessibility training offer improved
   scalability and efficacy when it comes to engaging and acknowledging the
   needs of dis/abled communities. Amplifying voices from the dis/abled
   community in training also personalizes the need to make content
   accessible. Approach: This article covers the module's creation and
   implementation via the iterative Analysis, Design, Development,
   Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) method. In doing so, it provides
   a framework for creating similar modules that industry practitioners and
   faculty can implement within their own organizations.
   Results/discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic led to fewer participants in
   the module than anticipated; however, preliminary feedback suggests the
   approach's efficacy. Conclusion: A train-the-trainer approach that
   integrates testimonials from the dis/abled community offers a
   user-focused means of disseminating accessibility guidelines that
   organizations should consider if looking for rapid scalability for new
   accessibility initiatives.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Cultural differences may be increasingly important in
   technical communication. Research is needed to investigate differences
   in document design practices and user preferences. This study examines
   cultural differences between Chinese and Western manuals for household
   appliances. Literature review: Earlier studies identified a wide range
   of possible differences between Chinese and Western documents, but the
   findings are not consistent and do not provide more generic perspectives
   on cultural differences. Possible reasons are the diversity of the
   documents used, the rather informal research designs, and relatively
   small sample sizes. Research question: To what extent and how do Chinese
   and Western manuals for household appliances differ from each other in
   terms of content, structure, and use of visuals? Methodology: To
   overcome these shortcomings, a quantitative content analysis was
   conducted, comparing 50 Chinese manuals and 50 Western manuals for
   household appliances. The coding scheme was based on earlier research
   findings and focused on content, structure, and the use of visuals.
   Results and conclusions: The results show that the content of Chinese
   manuals is less strictly confined to the function of user support than
   that of Western manuals. Compared to Western manuals, the structure of
   Chinese manuals appears to be fuzzier and less rigid. Regarding visuals,
   Chinese manuals contain more non-instrumental, entertaining
   illustrations than Western manuals. Underlying these differences is a
   more general distinction between highly instrumental Western manuals and
   more flexible Chinese manuals. These differences seem to point to two
   cultural dimensions: holistic versus analytic thinking and analog versus
   digital cultures.},

Title = {An Investigation of Maintenance Technicians' Information-Seeking
   Behavior in a Repair Center},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {Research problem: When it comes to understanding certain aspects of a
   maintenance technician's information-seeking behavior, knowledge is
   lacking. For instance, little is known about what kinds of information
   needs that maintenance technicians exhibit while performing work tasks
   and what types of sources they employ to satisfy those needs.
   Understanding such information-seeking behavior is especially essential
   for technical communicators who endeavor to design useful and relevant
   technical information. Research questions: 1. What information needs do
   maintenance technicians show evidence of while performing maintenance
   work tasks? 2. Where do they go to satisfy these information needs?
   Literature review: Current knowledge on maintenance technicians'
   information-seeking behavior is very limited. The literature reviewed
   for this study covers the task-based information-seeking behavior of
   different types of engineers and is mainly found within the field of
   library and information science research. This literature was selected
   because maintenance technicians and engineers share many
   characteristics. One information-seeking characteristic exhibited by
   engineers is the tendency to rely on internal company information, such
   as colleagues and self-created sources, before external information
   sources are consulted. Methodology: This study utilized an ethnographic
   research approach where empirical data were collected, analyzed, and
   interpreted from a theoretical viewpoint-a synthesis of Bystrom and
   Hansen's conceptual framework and the Systemic-Structural Theory of
   Activity. Seven in-house aftermarket maintenance technicians were
   observed via participant observation at a repair center in Sweden while
   they performed maintenance tasks on machines that had been taken out of
   service. Results and conclusions: The results-based on empirical data
   collected over the course of 12 days, spread over 12 weeks in the autumn
   of 2012-reveal that the observed maintenance technicians exhibited 50
   different types of information needs. They seldom sought instructions
   covering an entire work task. Instead, to satisfy their information
   needs, the maintenance technicians consulted four types of sources that,
   in the present study, have been designated as information source hosts.},

Abstract = {Introduction: This case study examines the impacts of component content
   management (CCM) on the ways global technical communication (TC)
   stakeholders practice multilingual quality. About the case: The case
   study is based on the results of a 12-month qualitative case study of
   global technical communication stakeholders at DreamMedi, a Fortune 500
   manufacturer of medical devices. Situating the case: Three areas of
   inquiry informed the study. Academic and trade literature from technical
   communication and technical translation revealed disagreements and
   contradictions that surround multilingual quality in CCM environments.
   Rhetorical genre theory allowed analyzing multilingual quality by
   distinguishing content components as a new genre, a unit of analysis,
   and a mediator of global technical communication. Activity theory
   provided the theoretical foundation for examining a global TC activity
   system at its nodes and then elucidating the contradictions within these
   nodes. Methods/approach: The case study was a multiple-method research
   project that included observations, in-depth interviews, questionnaires,
   document collection/content analysis, and software exploration. The
   Institutional Review Board-approved study focused on technical
   communicators, translators, and bilingual reviewers. Results/discussion:
   Relying on thick descriptions of the storylines of global TC
   stakeholders, this paper pinpoints contradictions in how stakeholders
   understand and approach multilingual quality. These contradictions are
   rooted in stakeholders' backgrounds and experience, and become more
   dramatic after the transition to CCM. Conclusions: Global TC
   stakeholders lacked strategies for negotiating their understandings of
   and approaches to multilingual quality in the new information
   development and management paradigm. Developing such strategies is the
   key prerequisite for effective cross-functional and cross-cultural
   collaboration in multilingual CCM environments. Technical communicators
   are well-positioned to take on leadership roles in developing such
   strategies.},

Title = {Evaluating Multilevel User Skill Expression in a Public, Unsupervised
   Wiki: A Case Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {261-273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: This case study examines how users of varied experience
   levels interact with an open-access content-management system (CMS) that
   lacks managed leadership. In particular, this case study compared how
   experienced and new users performed at a variety of tasks in a nonprofit
   community wiki to evaluate skill acquisition and possible skill loss.
   Research questions: (1) Do experienced users make more use of CMS
   features (templates, tags, hyperlinks) than new users, even without
   instruction? (2) Where do experienced and new users differ in successful
   task completion in the wiki? Situating the case: A number of
   content-management evaluations have utilized usability as a key method
   for evaluating user experience. In addition, Wikipedia has been a
   frequent target of investigation. This study looks to expand the
   crowdsourced wikis evaluated in this manner. Methodology: This case
   study started with a series of interviews to determine how users
   expected to use the community wiki. After the interviews, 10 users (5
   new and 5 experienced) were evaluated for this study, each performing 6
   tasks. About the case: This study looked at the initial installation of
   a local community wiki system. The system is a CMS designed for use by
   municipal territories to create crowdsourced wikis capable of preserving
   knowledge that would not traditionally fit in Wikipedia entries.
   Conclusions: Users who maintained sufficient interest in the wiki to
   become experienced wiki users developed a number of core skills even
   without organizational support, though new users demonstrated a steep
   skill deficit. However, new users actually demonstrated a greater
   capacity to highlight incompleteness of information within the wiki than
   experienced users in one key task.},

Title = {Client-Based Pedagogy Meets Workplace Simulation: Developing Social
   Processes in the Arisoph Case Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {140-152},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Teaching problem: Immersive pedagogies-including real-world or
   client-based projects, case studies, and simulations-have long been used
   to encourage student problem-solving, analytical thinking, and teamwork
   in professional communication. Building a connection to the real world
   has real challenges, however, for both instructors and students. How can
   we better prepare students for their future careers in our technical
   communication courses? Situating the case: This paper draws on three
   areas in the literature to situate the Arisoph case study: First, we
   discuss the work that has been done with client-based projects and the
   problems and challenges researchers have found with incorporating these
   projects into the classroom. Second, we discuss a newer model of
   workplace simulations, particularly focusing on the work done by Fisher
   and Russell. Third, we discuss the psychological theories of attribution
   and reattribution, which provided a foundation for our development of
   the Arisoph case study. How this case was studied: This paper describes
   the development of the Arisoph case study, an online client-based
   simulation course designed for engineering students to learn and
   practice technical communication. Course development and collection of
   instructor and student responses took place from 2010 to 2014. About the
   case: This paper details the development and implementation of the
   Arisoph case study, which brought the workplace realities of a variety
   of engineering professions into a classroom filled with engineering
   majors. The Arisoph simulation was designed to manage student
   attribution and reattribution, particularly to help engineering students
   connect the principles and skills learned in technical communication
   courses with their future careers. The Arisoph case study is a
   full-semester simulation, where students apply for work in a fictional
   company and fulfill different roles on professional teams. Each
   assignment during the semester is situated in the context of the
   simulation. The major projects for the simulation, however, come from a
   real client in the engineering field. This unique combination of
   simulation and client-based projects provides students with greater
   opportunities for successful reattribution. Conclusions: Initial student
   reactions to the course show an increased understanding of workplace
   communication and a greater motivation to produce the best possible
   product for the client. We hope that long-term studies will show
   significant carryover of those attitudes into students' careers.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Phishing is an email-based scam where a perpetrator
   camouflages emails to appear as a legitimate request for personal and
   sensitive information. Research question: How do individuals process a
   phishing email, and determine whether to respond to it? Specifically,
   this study examines how users' attention to ``visual triggers{''} and
   ``phishing deception indicators{''} influence their decision-making
   processes and consequently their decisions. Literature review: This
   paper draws upon the theory of deception and the literature on mediated
   cognition and learning, including the critical role of attention and
   elaboration in deception detection. From this literature, we developed a
   research model to suggest that overall cognitive effort expended in
   email processing decreases with attention to visual triggers and
   phishing deception indicators. The likelihood to respond to phishing
   emails increases with attention to visceral cues, but decreases with
   attention to phishing deception indicators and cognitive effort.
   Knowledge of email-based scams increases attention to phishing deception
   indicators, and directly decreases response likelihood. It also
   moderates the impact of attention to visceral triggers and that of
   phishing deception indicators on likelihood to respond. Methodology:
   Using a real phishing email as a stimulus, a survey of 321 members of a
   public university community in the Northeast US, who were intended
   victims of a spear phishing attack that took place, was conducted. The
   survey used validated measures developed in prior literature for the
   most part and tested results using the partial least-squares regression.
   Results and discussion: Our research model and hypotheses were supported
   by the data except that we did not find that cognitive effort
   significantly affects response likelihood. The implication of the study
   is that attention to visceral triggers, attention to phishing deception
   indicators, and phishing knowledge play critical roles in phishing
   detection. The limitations of the study were that the data were drawn
   from students, and the study explored one phishing attack, relied on
   some single-item measures, cognitive effort measure, and a one-round
   survey. Future research would examine the impact of a varying degree of
   urgency and a varying level of phishing deception indicators, and actual
   victims of phishing attacks.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Pages = {1-16},

Abstract = {This study investigated the impact of weblog use on individual learning
   in the context of university senior-Level business education. As an
   emergent form of personal communication, weblogs enable people to
   publish their thoughts as webpages, and to share information and
   knowledge. Recognizing the potential impact of weblogs on knowledge
   expression and sharing, this research sought to empirically examine
   whether the continuous use of weblogs as online learning logs would
   affect student learning performance. The assumption was that effective
   use of weblogs promoted the constructivist models of learning by
   supporting both cognitive and social knowledge construction, and by
   reinforcing individual accountability in learning. Results from an
   Information Systems undergraduate course with 31 participants indicated
   that the performance of students' weblogs was a significant predictor of
   the learning outcome (while traditional coursework was not). Moreover,
   individuals' cognitive construction effort to build their own mental
   models and social construction effort to further enrich/expand knowledge
   resources appeared to be two key aspects of the constructivist learning
   with weblogs. Our results imply the potential benefit of using weblogs
   as a knowledge construction tool and a social learning medium.},

   task or only reading the text. They then rated each sentence in terms of
   its difficulty and the type(s) of problem(s) it had (if any), and told
   how they would fix the problem(s). As predicted, participants who did
   the task tended to notice improperly ordered sentences, whereas those
   who only read the text (without seeing the device) tended to focus on
   grammatical problems. The results were consistent with the indexical
   hypothesis of Glenberg and Robertson (from their 1999 article in
   Discourse Processes).},

   The results revealed that while Americans performed equally well with

Abstract = {Using a qualitative approach to data collection and analysts, this
   article discusses some of the findings from a larger study on
   collaboration and the role of gender. Here, we profile three student
   engineering teams as they participate in processes leading to the
   submission of a report for a team-based technical communication course.
   While some theortists suggest that gender can play a significant role in
   achieving a successful team dynamic, our study only partially supports
   that claim, A synopsis of two women from two predominantly male teams
   reveals glimpses of what the literature describes as traditional
   gender-linked behaviors by both men and women, but the all:female team
   does not conform to stereotypical patterns and their behaviors call into
   question the existence of these interactional styles. We suggest that
   factors other than gender and independent of a team's gender
   composition-such as team commitment and a strong work ethic-exert a
   greater impact on collaboration. Nevertheless, the study does caution
   against assigning women to predominantly mate teams since, when a team's
   social structure is mostly male, traditional gender-linked interactional
   behaviors as well as manifestations of the culture of engineering are
   more likely to emerge. Overall, the study underlines the importance of
   examining specific face-to-face interactions to see how behavior is
   situationally produced in order to more fully understand the
   interactional strategies open to individuals.},

Title = {Archives, Rhetorical Absence, and Critical Imagination: Examining Black
   Women's Mental Health Narratives at Virginia's Central State Hospital},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Introduction: This article examines the rhetorical implications of
   archiving technical documents by studying the erasure of Black women's
   mental health narratives in Virginia's Central State Mental Hospital in
   the late 1800s and early 1900s. This article seeks to examine how
   historical mental health documents characterize (or fail to
   characterize) Black women and their mental health. About the case: We
   examine Black women's mental health experiences through absences in the
   annual reports from Central State Hospital in Virginia (formerly Central
   State Lunatic Asylum for Colored Insane). Situating the case: There is a
   dearth of work related to the unique experiences that Black women face
   when dealing with mental health challenges coupled with or compounded by
   a legacy of misogynoir. Methods/approach: We offer an inventive approach
   for reading rhetorical absences and provide guiding questions for
   employing the critical archival inquiry methodology. Results/discussion:
   In taking on this endeavor to learn more about how Black women's mental
   health was represented in historical archives, we learned a great deal,
   not from the text on the page of the documents but from the text that
   was missing from those documents. Conclusions: Technical communication
   scholars, especially those with an interest in inclusion and justice,
   must adjust their methodological orientation and their approaches to
   historical and archival research to include an exploration of what is
   missing from the archives. Technical and professional communicators have
   a unique skill set that is ideal for reading through absences and
   erasures in both contemporary and historical documents.},

Abstract = {Background: Data breaches happen when an unauthorized party gains access
   to personally identifiable information. They are becoming more common
   and impactful, raising serious concerns for individuals as well as
   companies. Literature review: Although there is considerable literature
   on users' mental models in security and privacy, there has been limited
   study of mental models related to data breaches. Research questions: 1.
   How do users understand data breaches? 2. What are their perceptions of
   the causes, responsibilities, and consequences, as well as possible
   prevention and appropriate follow up? Methodology: We explored end-user
   understanding of internet data breaches by conducting a study with 35
   participants. They were asked to draw their understanding of data
   breaches and answer some open-ended and closed-ended questions
   afterwards. Results/discussion: Although their drawings varied in detail
   and complexity, we identified four patterns in the participants'
   drawings: they illustrated abstractions of attacks to gain administrator
   access, end-user access, backdoor access, or access using database
   server vulnerabilities. We found that participants had a basic model of
   how an internet data breach happens, but with significant uncertainties
   regarding system vulnerabilities, causes, consequences, prevention
   methods, and follow-up steps after a breach. Conclusions: In all,
   end-user mental models of internet data breaches are basic and show gaps
   that emphasize the need for improved communication to increase users'
   awareness and help them hold companies accountable.},

Title = {Finding Stories in the Threads: Can Technical Communication Students
   Leverage User-Generated Content to Gain Subject-Matter Familiarity},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Previous research on user-generated content in technical
   communication focused primarily on non-traditional forms of technical
   communication outside of traditional institutions and organizations.
   User-generated content from the forum StackOverflow provides rich
   knowledge and stories behind problems faced by web and software
   developers. This study explores how technical communicators engage in
   this knowledge-rich content specific to web and software developers. Our
   findings provide insights into how researchers, instructors, and
   practicing technical communicators might leverage user-generated forum
   content in their work. Literature review: Previous research examined how
   user-generated content is a form of technical writing and technical
   editing. Furthermore, some research in technical communication has
   examined how technical user forums present a type of user-generated
   content to which technical communicators might add value. However, no
   research on user forums has explicitly examined how technical
   communicators engage in user forums to gain subject-matter familiarity
   or expertise. This study seeks to explore how technical communication
   students engage in user forums to troubleshoot coding problems. Research
   questions: 1. Are technical communication students able to successfully
   solve unfamiliar coding problems using user-generated content posted on
   the StackOverflow website Are they able to identify the conceptual
   knowledge needed to solve the coding problem 2. When learning about new,
   unfamiliar technical content, how do technical communication students
   search for information and decide which forum content to engage with 3.
   Do technical communication students make meaning and actively fill
   knowledge gaps when they engage in new, unfamiliar technical content on
   StackOverflow 4. After searching and reading through user-generated
   forum content to troubleshoot a coding task, do technical communication
   students feel confident enough in what they learned to teach someone
   else Results: Most participants were unable to solve any of the coding
   problems using StackOverflow. Those who did successfully troubleshoot
   the coding problems exhibited more active scanning when selecting a
   search thread and made meaning of thread content more closely.
   Conclusions: Actively engaging and making meaning of thread content
   reveals insights into the stories behind the thread. These stories
   provide important details and clues for gaining subject-matter
   familiarity, but users must actively engage in meaning-making to access
   the stories and fill knowledge gaps. Practitioners and instructors can
   leverage content on StackOverflow to better understand coding problems.
   StackOverflow threads, along with other user-generated forum content,
   also give instructors insight into technical audiences and can be
   leveraged to teach students how to use primary research to better
   understand audiences. Researchers can continue to study how novice users
   interact with user-generated content by investigating how confidence
   levels affect meaning-making.},

Abstract = {Background: Knowledge workers have become
   ``technologically-tethered,{''} increasingly using mobile and
   communication technologies to engage in work during nonwork or
   ``after-hours{''} personal time. Literature review: Research has
   identified several individual- and organizational-level predictors of
   this after-hours technology-enabled work behavior and its primarily
   negative consequences. However, little is known regarding the behavior's
   potential benefits or the ways in which it is affected by technology
   characteristics. Research questions: 1. How do technology
   characteristics affect after-hours work connectivity? 2. How does
   after-hours technology use affect work-life balance? Methodology: We
   test our hypotheses with a survey-based research design involving 312
   knowledge workers, and analyze our data with covariance-based structural
   equation modeling. Results: After-hours work connectivity increases when
   the technology affords lower levels of immediacy and greater levels of
   concurrency, rehearsability, and reprocessability. A post-hoc analysis
   reveals that workers who might be expected to have low levels of
   after-hours work connectivity-such as those who have children at home or
   whose employers have a high segmentation norm-have higher levels of
   after-hours connectivity than their counterparts when the technology has
   high concurrency. We also find support for a curvilinear (inverted-U
   shaped) relationship between after-hours technology use and work-life
   balance. Conclusion: Individuals are amenable to interweaving
   technology-enabled work with nonwork tasks when the technology
   facilitates asynchronous and user-controlled interactions. Furthermore,
   this interweaving has a positive impact on work-life balance, up to a
   point. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and
   practice.},

Title = {Framing Controversy on Social Media: \#NoDAPL and the Debate About the

Abstract = {Background: This research explores how controversial engineering
   decisions become the subject of widespread social media debates, using
   the prominent case of activism opposed to the Dakota Access pipeline
   (DAPL). The \#NoDAPL Twitter hashtag became the primary vehicle for
   activism, with Twitter users shaping the debate through how they framed
   the controversy. Literature review: Framing refers to how information is
   packaged and presented. Because framing shapes the interpretation of
   information, it plays a crucial role in scientific controversies.
   Research questions: 1. Which framing strategies are present in the most
   influential (determined by the number of retweets and ``likes{''}) posts
   using \#NoDAPL on Twitter? 2. How do the framing strategies used in the
   most influential \#NoDAPL tweets change in relation to major political
   events? 3. Do the framing strategies used in the most influential
   \#NoDAPL tweets amplify the echo-chamber effect and polarization on
   Twitter? Methodology: The team collected daily data on the \#NoDAPL
   hashtag and selected tweets with \#NoDAPL that had more than 1500 likes
   or retweets, and categorized them by the frames that they exhibited.
   Results and discussion: The most-used frames were conflict/ strategy and
   morality/ ethics, with no noticeable middle path frame, leading to the
   echo-chamber effect and online polarization. The scientific/ technical
   uncertainty frame was used only sporadically, in contrast with project
   proponents who tried to emphasize the pipeline's safety. Implications:
   Engineers seeking to understand and participate in public debates about
   issues central to their profession should recognize and engage the
   frames being used by the public to understand information. The project
   proponents' defense of the pipeline fell on deaf ears, likely because
   they focused on safety rather than broader questions of morality. While
   engineers should share technical information related to a project under
   fire, they cannot ignore the concerns expressed by their critics.},

Abstract = {This tutorial explores ethical implications of cognitive load theory and
   intersectional theory on technical and professional communication, and
   proposes plain language as an ethical imperative to redress social
   inequities. Key concepts: When the cognitive load of a learning task is
   too high and overwhelms working memory, learning is impaired. The
   greater stress and mental burden that marginalized populations
   experience can leave less working memory available for reading and
   learning. Using plain language to reduce cognitive load can be
   considered a political act that increases marginalized populations'
   opportunities to understand. Key lessons: 1. Consider whether
   marginalized populations are part of your audience. 2. Using personas to
   represent those populations, audit their mental burden to exercise
   cognitive empathy. 3. Consider reducing cognitive load via plain
   language an ethical imperative. Implications for practice: Assessing the
   presence and absence of specific marginalized groups is iterative and
   takes practice, but developing plain-language communications that
   accommodate these audiences reduces cognitive load for all readers. And
   although personas are useful for developing cognitive empathy, nothing
   replaces user testing in determining your communication's effectiveness.},

Title = {Communicating With Employees: Resisting the Stereotypes of Generational

Abstract = {Introduction: Stereotypes about generational cohorts have been spread
   widely among current literature; this study challenges those stereotypes
   and provides a simple method for managers to learn how to effectively
   communicate with, motivate, and retain employees, no matter what cohort
   they belong to. Research questions: ( 1) Do people in a particular
   generational cohort behave according to the stereotypes assigned to
   their cohort? ( 2) Do people in a particular generation believe that the
   stereotypes assigned to their generation are accurate? Literature
   review: Current literature promulgates generational stereotypes and
   encourages managers to learn about the differences of each cohort so
   that they can tailor their communication to each cohort. Knowing the
   differences allegedly provides managers of technical communication teams
   or any team with more effective strategies to communicate with,
   motivate, and retain members of each cohort. Much of the literature
   examined was not based on rigorous research, and some that was rigorous
   and empirical claims there are more similarities than differences among
   the cohorts. Methodology: The findings from this study are based on
   answers to surveys from 107 participants and semistructured interviews
   with eight of those participants who were employees at a software
   company or were students or employees at a local university. The
   findings challenge the stereotypes found in the current literature,
   specifically concerning longevity in a job and workplace compliance.
   Conclusions, limitations, and future research: Managers need to learn
   more about individual employees rather than relying on stereotypes of
   generational cohorts when communicating with employees. Learning about
   individuals is simple and can foster more effective communication, which
   will enhance employees' job satisfaction and engagement, and ultimately
   employee retention. As the research reported in this study shows, these
   are crucial variables to consider about a person's tenure in a position
   and workplace compliance behavior but are not included by most when
   studying generational cohorts. Further research could help us learn how
   managers can best develop employees and recognize and reward employees'
   workplace achievements.},

Abstract = {This study aims to provide scholars with insight into the task of
   writing research articles. Research questions: (1) What are the generic
   structures of research article introductions in three engineering
   subdisciplines? and (2) What are variations that distinguish the
   introductions of one subdiscipline from the others? Literature review:
   Swales's genre analysis method has proved to be an effective textual
   analysis to identify the structural organization of each section of
   research articles. Even though there seems to be a pattern in each
   section, previous genre-based studies also demonstrate that disciplinary
   variation is discernible. It thus remains to be determined whether
   research articles of different subdisciplines within a single discipline
   share the same organizational structure. Methodology: Based on journal
   impact factors, three datasets of English research article introductions
   representing three subdisciplines of engineering (civil, software, and
   biomedical) were compiled, consisting of 180 introductions with 60 from
   each subdiscipline. Then, the three datasets were analyzed using
   Swales's genre analysis technique to identify the structural patterns
   prevalent in the introductions of each subdiscipline. Units of textual
   analysis called moves and steps were quantified to capture variations
   among the introductions. Results and discussion: Analysis shows that
   these introductions generally adhere to a common rhetorical organization
   across subdisciplines. However, disciplinary variations are also
   captured, highlighting the unique characteristics and perspectives of
   each subdiscipline. The findings bear pedagogical implications, allowing
   English for Specific Purposes practitioners to prepare novice scholars
   to be able to publish successfully in their fields.},

Title = {Facilitating Knowledge Sharing Through a Boundary Spanner},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of the study was to explore how a boundary
   spanner can successfully facilitate knowledge sharing across functional
   and geographical boundaries. The main research questions are: (1) Does
   matching the complexity of knowledge boundary with the knowledge-sharing
   process lead to successful knowledge sharing? and (2) What are the key
   factors that influence a boundary spanner when deciding how to
   facilitate the knowledge sharing across functional and location
   boundaries? Literature review: The purpose of the literature review was
   to better understand the existing knowledge-sharing frameworks. Finding
   no framework that can directly address the research problem, the
   researchers decided to build on the closest one which is a framework for
   knowledge sharing across functional boundaries. By not taking into
   consideration knowledge sharing across location boundaries, the
   framework assumes collocated and synchronous knowledge-sharing
   interaction. To understand the potential supporting media for
   knowledge-sharing interaction across functional and geographical
   boundaries, the researchers consulted the Media Naturalness Theory.
   Media naturalness is the ability of the media to support a sense of
   collocated and synchronous interaction. Methodology: The researchers
   conducted a qualitative exploratory case study in the IT department of a
   Fortune 500 multinational finance company. Researchers selected a
   boundary spanner and observed her facilitation of knowledge-sharing
   interactions for four months. A total of 78 knowledge-sharing
   interaction logs were collected during the period of observation from
   five data sources: wiki, email, instant messaging, teleconference, and
   face-to-face interactions. Data analysis was carried out through
   template coding. Results and discussion: The researchers found that
   matching the knowledge boundary with the knowledge-sharing process is an
   essential yet insufficient condition for successful knowledge sharing. A
   boundary spanner should also pay attention to the boundary objects and
   media used to support the knowledge-sharing interaction. Spatial
   dispersion and knowledge commonality between the source/recipient and
   boundary spanner affected the media selection which, in turn, influenced
   the selection of the boundary objects. The implication of the study is
   that there are three important factors that the boundary spanner should
   consider when deciding how to facilitate knowledge sharing (i.e.,
   knowledge boundary, spatial dispersion, and knowledge commonality). The
   main limitations of the study were the relatively short observation
   period of the knowledge-sharing interactions via a boundary spanner.
   Future research should quantitatively validate the proposed optimal
   knowledge-sharing designs to test the generalizability of the findings
   with a survey and profile deviation analysis.},

Abstract = {On the basis of an extensive survey study conducted among business
   professionals engaging in global communication, this paper discusses
   communicative competence. Rapid changes in work environments,
   particularly advancing globalization and new technology, have
   highlighted the need for expanding our knowledge of the elements that
   constitute communicative competence in global encounters. Competence has
   been investigated by several researchers; however, the language
   perspective, particularly the language used for international
   communication, that is, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), has largely
   been ignored. Our findings indicate that global communicative competence
   (GCC) consists of three layers: multicultural competence, competence in
   English as a Business Lingua Franca (BELF) and the communicator's
   business know-how. Based on our findings, we present a model for GCC,
   which includes language as a key component. Implications for theory,
   practice, and education include the need for a multidisciplinary
   approach and the acknowledgement of ELF/BELF as the language of global
   interaction. ELF/BELF assumes a shared ``core{''} of the English
   language, but focuses on interactional skills, rapport building, and the
   ability to ask for and provide clarifications.},

Abstract = {Knowledge contribution in virtual communities is an important issue in
   the field of knowledge management. Based on Ames's theoretical framework
   on motivation, we propose a model for knowledge contribution in
   problem-solving virtual communities (PSVCs). The model includes two
   second-order individual motivations, with four major mechanisms in PSVCs
   that are associated with these motivations. Results confirm that only
   egoistic motives affect members' knowledge contribution in PSVCs.
   Further, knowledge repository and social identity are found to be
   important mechanisms for promoting knowledge contribution through
   egoistic motives. This paper concludes with theoretical and practical
   implications and provides insights for future research.},

Abstract = {In 1848, Scientific American, a popular science and technology journal,
   published a series criticizing Morse v. O'Reilly's (1848) confirmation
   of Samuel Morse's broad telegraph patent and patenting scientific
   principles. It attacked the decision using copia and classification,
   rhetoric echoed by the Supreme Court and others in reversing the 1848
   decision. The journal was particularly concerned with the case's
   implications for Morse's patent battles with Royal House and Alexander
   Bain. The articles offer an opportunity to examine the rhetoric of
   patent debates and differences in the rhetoric of professional and
   scientific journals without the emotional attachments of examining
   contemporary issues.},

   play a mediational, intervening role in the successful administration of
   online surveys? What are the general costs and benefits of conducting
   survey research? Based on the activity of administering an online survey
   (N = 334) testing knowledge and understanding of US copyright law among
   digital writers (both students and teachers) in US technical and
   professional writing (TPW) programs, I blend Rhetorical Theory with
   Activity Theory by conducting a rhetorical analysis within an Activity

   attempts to recruit individuals to respond to an online survey.},

Abstract = {Information security and privacy on the internet are critical issues in
   our society. In this, research, we examine factors that influence
   internet users' private-information-sharing behavior. Based on a survey
   of 285 preteens and early teens, who are among the most vulnerable
   groups on the web, this study provides a research framework that
   explains an internet user's information privacy protection behavior.
   According to our study results, internet users' information privacy
   behaviors are affected by two signficant factors: (1) users' perceived
   importance of information privacy and (2) information privacy
   self-efficacy. The study also found that users believe in the value of
   online information privacy and that information privacy protection
   behavior varies by gender. Our findings indicate that educational
   opportunities regarding internet privacy and computer security as well
   as concerns from other reference groups (e.g., peer, teacher, and
   parents) play an important role in positively affecting the internet
   users' protective behavior regarding online privacy.},

Abstract = {With the advent of handy internet building tools, online surveys are
   becoming a promising alternative to traditional paper- and mail-based
   surveys to collect data for survey research. While conducting online
   surveys has its advantages, it comes with a unique set of challenges.
   Leveraging our experience in developing multiple online surveys, we
   highlight some of the critical issues of the process. This tutorial
   provides insights to develop and conduct online surveys effectively. In
   a step-by-step process, we offer recommendations to researchers at
   various decision stages of developing an online survey, from initial
   planning through the final data-collection phase.},

Abstract = {Based on an interpretive case study in a large petrochemical company,
   this paper provides evidence for a theoretical framework based on the
   relationship of abstract and personal trust to the effectiveness of
   long-term virtual teams. This theory of virtual teams states that, when
   all other enabling factors for trust and effective virtual team working
   are conducive, then four elements exist: first, personal trust is most
   effectively established or reinvigorated through geographically
   collocated social interaction; second, personal trust is an antecedent
   to the activation and operation of effective virtual teams; third,
   abstract trust is an alternative to personal trust as an antecedent to
   the activation and operation of effective, short-term virtual teams; and
   finally, personal trust gradually dissipates over time without
   collocated social interaction. This theory leads to four propositions
   about the role of ubiquitous computing for virtual teams. These
   propositions draw from the mobility brought by ubiquitous computing to
   potential and active virtual teams. The mobility can be used to
   collocate (perhaps rhythmically or routinely) team members for the
   purpose of enabling or sustaining perpetual virtual teams.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we first develop a framework of user-database
   interaction. Based on this framework, we then provide a discussion on
   how notable human factors influence various dimensions of user-database
   interaction. Following that, we propose using cognitive mapping
   techniques to overcome some cognitive and behavioral biases during
   user-database interaction. Three popular cognitive mapping
   techniques-causal mapping, semantic mapping, and concept mapping-are
   introduced as techniques to elicit an individual's belief systems
   regarding a problem domain. Through an example database application, we
   demonstrate how to use these cognitive mapping techniques to improve
   user-database interaction. Finally, we discuss the implications of this
   research for technical communicators during user-database interaction
   analysis and design.},

Abstract = {While there have-been measurable improvements in the technical
   development of multimedia, research from a sociotechnical viewpoint
   suggests that the benefits of multimedia technology, especially in
   fulfilling user requirements, do not always live up to initial promises.
   This paper aims to address one of the fundamental, but often neglected,
   areas in user requirements, i.e., gender-related issues. The paper
   identifies and discusses gender differences in multimedia communication
   and suggests how the differences can be addressed. It proposes a model
   for accommodating gender differences in multimedia communication.},

Abstract = {Background: Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue
   in higher education (HE). Leadership statements in university
   sustainability reports (LSUSR) represent a unique genre for university
   leaders to communicate sustainability. This study aims to demystify the
   genre so that future leadership statements might be crafted with a
   greater degree of reflexivity. Literature review: Sustainability
   discourse in HE has been regarded as a legitimacy tool and an
   opportunity for image improvement for universities. Some studies have
   examined university sustainability reports, whereas there is a lack of
   studies focusing on the section of leadership statements. Research
   question: Are there any cross-cultural similarities or differences in
   terms of rhetorical moves and communicative purposes between the Italian
   LSUSR genre and the American LSUSR genre? Research methodology: Using
   cross-cultural genre analysis, this study investigates the rhetorical
   moves of leadership statements produced by Italian and American
   universities. A move scheme is established and is used to annotate the
   sample texts. Results and conclusion: The findings show that although
   the Italian and American LSUSR genres share the communicative purpose of
   establishing a sustainable image, the degree of discourse force exerting
   on this communicative purpose varies. The image-building discourse force
   appears to be more noticeable in the American leadership statements,
   which tend to use a wider range and a larger quantity of image-improving
   moves. The Italian subcorpus, on the other hand, seems to pay more
   attention to the genre function of report-introducing, which is not
   explicitly linked to image improvement. This article suggests that
   practitioners could consider the potentials of the LSUSR genre in
   developing an institutional culture of sustainability.},

Abstract = {Background: The linguistic framing strategies used in media reporting on
   illegal drugs have been extensively documented, but less attention has
   been directed toward visuals, particularly data visualizations.
   Literature review: Positioning illegal drug use as a criminal justice
   problem or a public health issue are types of frameworks that use
   specific rhetorical strategies. Research questions: 1. What are the
   rhetorical strategies used in data visualizations published during the
   crack and opioid drug epidemics, respectively? 2. Do these strategies
   advance dominant media narratives that crack addiction should be
   criminalized but opioid addiction should be treated like a public health
   issue? And if so, how is this accomplished? Methodology: Drawing from
   the media studies approach previously employed in a study in technical
   and professional communication (TPC) on information design trends, I
   apply the concept of ``scripto-visual{''} rhetoric to select data
   visualizations published by mainstream news media during both drug
   epidemics. Results: I argue these graphics escalated the perceived
   threat during both drug epidemics but different scripto-visual
   rhetorical strategies were used. Conclusions: Attending to ethical
   considerations in the creation of data visualizations has long been
   important in TPC, while scholarship has integrated social justice as a
   core component of the discipline. In the last section of this article, I
   bring these themes together by arguing that a social justice ethic is
   needed in data design work. I then propose a critical heuristic
   constructed from Jones et al.'s positionality, privilege, and power
   framework that can be used analytically or as an inventional tool to
   tease out the ways particular scripto-visual rhetorical decisions may be
   promoting inequities.},

Abstract = {Background: In this article, we document how our team of translators,
   interpreters, technical communicators, and health justice workers is
   collaborating to (re)design COVID-19-related technical documentation for
   and with Indigenous language speakers in Gainesville, FL, USA; Oaxaca de
   Juarez, Mexico; and Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Literature review:
   Although (mis)representations of Indigenous communities have been an
   ongoing issue in and beyond technical communication, the COVID-19
   pandemic has brought added attention to how government institutions and
   other agencies fail to consider the cultural values, languages, and
   communication practices of Indigenous communities when writing,
   designing, and sharing technical information. Research questions: 1. How
   can technical communicators work toward social justice in health through
   collaborative design with Indigenous language speakers? 2. How can
   technical documentation about COVID-19 be (re)designed alongside members
   of vulnerable communities to redress oppressive representations while
   increasing access and usability? Methodology: Through interviews and
   other participatory design activities conducted with Indigenous language
   speakers in the US, Guatemala, and Mexico, we illustrate how Western
   approaches to creating technical documentation, particularly in
   health-related contexts such as the COVID-19 pandemic, put communities
   at risk by failing to localize health messaging for Indigenous
   audiences. We then document our work intended to collaboratively design
   and translate COVID-19-related technical information alongside those
   Indigenous language speakers to benefit Indigenous language speakers in
   Gainesville and other parts of North Central Florida. Results: Through
   this discussion, we highlight how technical communicators can
   collaborate with Indigenous language speakers to create, translate, and
   share multilingual technical documents that can contribute to social
   justice efforts by enhancing language access. Conclusion: Through
   collaborations with Indigenous language speakers, translators, and
   interpreters, social/health justice projects in technical communication
   can be combined, localized, and adapted to better serve and represent
   the diversity of people, languages, and cultures that continue to
   increase in our world.},

Title = {Asynchronous Collaboration: Bridging the Cognitive Distance in Global
   Software Development Projects},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {361-371},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research problem: The role that physical, temporal, and cultural
   distances play in global software development projects has been well
   researched. Culturally diverse teams separated by physical distances
   across multiple time zones face significant challenges in collaborating
   effectively with each other. This article examines a fourth
   dimension-cognitive distance-that relates to the problem-solving style
   of teams that can also have an impact on their ability to collaborate
   successfully. Research questions: 1. Does cognitive distance affect
   communication among global software development teams collaborating with
   each other? 2. How does cognitive distance affect the sentiment/emotion
   of global software development teams collaborating with each other?
   Literature review: Prior research shows that collaboration among teams
   on global software development projects is impacted by practices to
   manage collaboration; appropriate use of collaboration technologies;
   collaboration readiness that relates to individual characteristics such
   as personality traits, motivation, and trust; and shared understanding
   in group problem-solving. While shared understanding has looked at the
   effectiveness of the use of common language and knowledge sharing, it
   has not examined how differences in problem-solving styles of
   geographically dispersed teams impact their ability to collaborate
   successfully. Methodology: We examined project artifacts and email
   communication among geographically dispersed teams within a global
   software development project. From the project artifacts, we examined
   tasks allocated to different teams. From the emails, we established the
   communication network and volume of communication, and performed a
   sentiment analysis on email content. This analysis allowed us to observe
   not only the quality of communication among the teams but also the
   sentiment/emotion that reflected how well they were working together.
   Results and discussion: Managing teams that vastly differ in
   problem-solving styles and tasks requires that project managers be aware
   of these differences and introduce liaisons that reach across the teams
   to help bridge the cognitive divide.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Background: Captions do important communicative work, but little
   research has investigated their content quantitatively. Literature
   review: Captions help facilitate learning and make retrieving
   information from databases easier. Yet, few studies have explored the
   rhetorical moves found in figure captions to better understand their
   communicative function. Research questions: 1. How do captions found in
   psychology, linguistics, biology, and technical and professional
   communication (TPC) journals differ in terms of length? 2. What are the
   rhetorical structures of figure captions in psychology, linguistics,
   biology, and TPC journals? 3. How do the rhetorical structures of
   captions in journals from these four disciplines differ? 4. To what
   extent does visual type interact with caption length and rhetorical
   structure? Research methodology: Using quantitative content analysis, I
   compared the frequencies of moves in captions across disciplines,
   determined whether the moves were conventional or optional, and
   identified patterns in the progression of moves in the captions that I
   analyzed. A supplementary analysis of the types of visuals that
   accompanied the captions offered insights into the findings of the
   caption-content analysis. Results: Results suggest a high degree of
   variation in the rhetorical structure of captions in academic journals.
   Biology captions were, on average, the longest and contained the most
   moves. TPC captions were the shortest and contained the fewest moves.
   Psychology and linguistics captions fell between the biology and TPC
   captions. Conclusions: Understanding variation in caption content can
   encourage a more rhetorical approach to caption writing. Researchers in
   disciplines where shorter captions are standard might consider writing
   elaborated captions.},

Abstract = {Background: Environmental reporting is an indispensable part of the
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) report, which has become a main
   genre of nonfinancial disclosure for corporations. The present study
   explores how companies use metaphors to construct their role in the
   relationship with the environment. Literature review: Previous studies
   tend to focus on environmental metaphors in genres such as newspapers,
   blogs, and scientific discourse, but rarely attend to the genre of
   corporate environmental reporting. Research questions: 1. What metaphors
   are used by banking and energy companies to represent their role in the
   relationship with the environment? Are there similarities or differences
   across cultures? 2. What are their representations in terms of the
   corporate role, and what impacts do they have on the environment from an
   ecolinguistic perspective? 3. Why are these metaphors used for
   environmental communication? Research methodology: The study
   investigates a corpus of 180 CSR reports published by Chinese, US, and
   Italian companies with the framework of critical metaphor analysis
   combined with genre analysis, so as to approach metaphor use from a
   cross-cultural perspective. Results and conclusions: The study
   highlights both universal metaphors (manager, protector, and traveler)
   and culture-specific metaphors (the bee metaphor in Chinese, the steward
   metaphor in English, and the fighter metaphor in Italian) across three
   languages, which are used to represent the company's good intentions,
   caring attitude, and responsible behavior, contributing to building an
   environmentally responsible corporate image. Some of the metaphors seem
   useful in inspiring eco-constructive behavior, while others may bear
   eco-destructive connotations.},

Abstract = {User experience (UX), a common practice in corporate settings, is new
   for many nonprofit organizations. This case study details a
   community-based research project between nonprofit staff at a community
   health center and UX professionals to improve the design and usability
   of a document designed to help immigrant patients sign up for health
   insurance. UX professionals may need to adapt and be flexible with their
   efforts, but can offer valuable skills to community partners. Research
   questions: (1) What are the information needs and barriers faced by
   immigrant populations signing up for health insurance? (2) How does a
   usability study, adapted to meet the needs of immigrant populations,
   inform the design of a supplemental guidebook about health insurance?
   (3) What are the challenges and opportunities when engaging in
   community-based UX research projects? Situating the case: Other
   community-based research projects in technical communication and UX
   point to the need for a clear conceptualization of participation, a
   strong partnership with nonprofits, and the need to develop meaningful
   and actionable insights. Furthermore, when conducting studies with
   immigrant populations, the role of the translator on the research team
   is crucial. Methodology: As a community-based research project focused
   on the collaborative generation of practical knowledge, we conducted a
   usability study with 12 participants in two language groups, Chinese and
   Vietnamese, to evaluate the design and usability of a guidebook designed
   to provide guidance about enrolling in a health insurance plan. Data
   were analyzed to identify usability concerns and used to inform a second
   iteration of the guidebook. About the case: Immigrant populations
   struggle to sign up for health insurance for a variety of reasons,
   including limited English and health insurance literacy. As a result, a
   nonprofit community health center developed a guidebook to support
   immigrant populations. Version 1 of this guidebook was evaluated in a
   usability study, with results showing that users struggled to correctly
   choose a plan, determine their eligibility, and interpret abstract
   examples. As a result, Version 2 was designed to support the in-person
   experience, reduce visual complexity, and support patients' key
   questions. Conclusions: Community-based UX collaborations can amplify
   the expertise of UX and nonprofit professionals. However, UX methods may
   need to be adapted in community-based projects to better incorporate
   local knowledge and needs.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Although labor statistics document a steady rise in
   contract, contingent, and entrepreneurial labor, knowledge about the
   professional communication practices that build and sustain independent
   careers in the field of technical communication (TC) largely emerges
   from broad survey analysis, cultural/social critiques, or individual
   anecdotes. From these statistics and stories, we already know that
   independent technical communicators face challenges ranging from legal
   issues to establishing marketing visibility when they start and maintain
   businesses. Drawing on thick qualitative description from semistructured
   interviews, this article responds to the need for more systematic
   research tracing the networking practices, technologies, and
   relationships that enable entrepreneurial work. Research question: How
   do established individual entrepreneurs in TC describe the social
   relationships, networking practices, and networking technologies that
   shape their careers over time? Literature review: This project extends
   prior research at the intersections of entrepreneurship, technical
   communication, and social networks. Entrepreneurial studies research
   indicates that strong social ties and embeddedness influence venture
   performance; however, systematic scholarship on the networks or
   networking practices of independent or entrepreneurial technical
   communication practice has been limited. Methodology: The project used
   semistructured interviews to analyze the professional communication
   practices of eight technical communicators with considerable experience
   working independently as consultants or small-business owners. We used
   an online search to identify experienced entrepreneurs in the
   interdisciplinary field of technical communication. After recruiting
   participants via email, we conducted semistructured interviews to gather
   employment narratives, while prompting participants to share information
   about career-relevant ties, networking practices, and networking
   technologies. We then analyzed data through two iterative qualitative
   coding passes. Results and conclusions: Our participants, made up of
   experienced TC entrepreneurs, have used networking over at least two
   decades to advance personal business outcomes and evolve technical
   communication as a field and profession. Findings detail how networking
   is central to professional social knowledge construction, as TC
   entrepreneurs establish transactional contact with others, practice
   learning, and enact exponential reputation-building that addresses the
   isolation of working outside traditional organizations. Since this is a
   qualitative study based on self-report, the results are not
   generalizable but provide a foundation for future larger-scale research
   building from these qualitative themes.},

Abstract = {Communication skills are key to the workforce success of engineering
   graduates. The Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering
   (ISyE) Workforce Communication Program at Georgia Tech has successfully
   incorporated executive panel interaction into its capstone design course
   to align student skills with executive expectations. The objectives of
   the panel are to raise student awareness about the importance of
   communication to workforce success and to gain knowledge about
   communication skills directly from executives. Executives interact
   directly with students about workforce communication, career
   advancement, and the communication skills they consider most critical.
   The process of assembling and holding a panel is described for potential
   implementation in other engineering programs.},

Abstract = {Instant messaging (IM) has the potential to be a powerful collaborative
   workplace communication tool. As this information and Communication
   technology (ICT) becomes more diffused at work, it is important to
   consider how the workers will cope with yet another communication
   option. Using a cost-minimization perspective. this proposition-building
   piece links three types of costs associated with IM use, delay, access.
   and error. With two salient workplace concerns. productivity and
   communication overload. The delay costs associated with IM use are
   considerably lower than with other ICTs. While increased use of IM can
   enhance productivity, it might also lead to perceptions of overload. IM
   access costs include organizational access, interruptions, user
   experiences, User differences. and generational differences-variables
   that influence one another and can lead to either outcome. Error costs
   come in two forms: single-channel factors and message quality issues.
   These likely lead to increased communication overload and decreased
   productivity. Combining IM with other ICTs is a likely moderator in this
   relationship and might help overcome the single-channel factors. The
   resulting eight propositions and theoretical model provide a predictive
   framework to focus future workplace IM use studies.},

Abstract = {Technical communication textbooks tend to address visual rhetoric as two
   separate units, usually a chapter on document design and then a chapter
   on graphics. We advocate teaching a unified system of visual rhetoric
   that encompasses both text and graphics within a common visual-language
   system. Using C. S. Peirce's three-part theory of rhetoric and his ten
   categories of sign, we offer an integrated semiotic system, interpreting
   in one model the effectiveness of graphics, document design, and
   formatting, all considered as subtypes in this proposed visual rhetoric,
   organized around three primary communication goals: to decorate, to
   indicate, and to inform. Thus, any evaluation of visuals, either textual
   or graphic, must be made with reference to rhetorical contexts in which
   audience needs and graphic/textual media choices should align with
   authorial goals.},

Abstract = {This genre-based study comprises a comparative content analysis of
   textual and pictorial themes in a corpus of Dutch-English and British
   managerial forewords. It indicates that there are significant thematic
   differences between the Dutch-English CEO's statements, the British
   CEO's statements, and the British Chairman's statements and that these
   may be attributable to communicative and historical conventions as well
   as to current affairs in a particular business community. The present
   analysis, therefore, suggests that these managerial forewords cannot be
   considered as identical texts, although all are part of the same
   comprehensive document (i.e., the annual report). As such, this study
   suggests that text analysts, instructors, and practitioners in
   intercultural communication should be sensitive to both textual and
   contextual features for a full understanding of professional texts in
   intercultural discourse situations.},

Title = {Toward a Greater Understanding of the Use of Nonverbal Cues To Deception
   in Computer-Mediated Communication},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Pages = {131-149},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is an important part
   of work life. However, this communication can be dishonest, and when
   people attempt to judge dishonesty, irrespective of the cues available,
   they tend to rely on a few nonverbal cues that are not the most
   reliable.Literature review: According to leakage theory, CMC modes
   differ from each other in the number of cues to deception they can
   transmit, potentially affecting one's ability to detect deception in a
   given medium. There is considerable research on peoples' use of
   nonverbal cues across CMC modes to evaluate deception, but limited
   understanding of the choices they make and the extent to which their
   deception judgments are impaired or helped by cues they have access to
   for different CMC modes.Research questions: 1. To what extent are the
   nonverbal cues that people say they rely on to detect deception shaped
   by the medium that they use for communication? 2. What are the effects
   of nonverbal cue availability on deception detection
   success?Methodology: We conducted an experiment with 132 veracity judges
   from New Zealand and Jamaica, who observed interview segments in Spanish
   and Hindi (languages that they did not understand) to isolate the
   effects of nonverbal cues. They determined the veracity of each segment
   and listed the things that guided their judgment.Results/discussion: The
   results suggest that when certain nonverbal cues are available, such as
   gaze aversion, these suppress attention to more reliable cues (e.g.,
   voice pitch) when judging deception. Redirecting attention to more
   reliable cues is therefore important. Unexpectedly, cue choice also
   varied across language by medium.Conclusions: The findings extend the
   understanding of people's use of nonverbal cues and the extent to which
   certain cues distract in the deception judgment. Although people rely on
   vocalic cues in audio-only media and kinesic cues in video-only media,
   they tend to rely mostly on, and are distracted by, a few kinesic cues
   for full audiovisual media, even though vocalic cues are available. We
   also found that people can successfully detect cues to deception, even
   when their communication mode is relatively bereft of useful
   information. However, the availability (or lack) of nonverbal cues was
   not a factor in deception detection success. To improve detection,
   deception training that targets reliable cues for different media is
   needed.},

Abstract = {Background: Technical writing is a critical professional skill for
   engineers, but engineering students often perceive writing as less
   important. Literature review: Research suggests feedback, revision, and
   reflective writing support conceptual learning. However, just as student
   beliefs about intelligence impact engagement and learning outcomes,
   beliefs about writing may likewise affect how valuable writing is to
   learning. Research questions: 1. Do student beliefs-expressed in
   reflections-depict writing as a learning process or as a deterministic
   artifact? 2. To what extent do these expressed beliefs explain variance
   in their conceptual learning in a chemical engineering laboratory
   course? Research methodology: A design-based research study was
   conducted in three semesters of an upper division chemical engineering
   laboratory course to jointly study the use of feedback, revision, and
   reflection, and to develop contextualized theory about the relationships
   between these and students' conceptual learning. Students' writing was
   analyzed qualitatively. Regression modelling explained variance in
   scores of students' conceptual understanding. Results: We found that
   students who elaborated on errors and corrections scored significantly
   lower on conceptual understanding in their final submission, while
   students who described writing as an ongoing process scored
   significantly higher on conceptual understanding in their final reports.
   We found a similar trend for students who completed a second cycle, and
   especially that a focus on perfecting a written artifact corresponded to
   lesser gains. Conclusions: Our findings lend support for assisting
   engineering students to approach writing as a developmental and learning
   process and for engaging them in multiple rounds of feedback, revision,
   and reflection across their programs of study.},

Abstract = {Objective: We designed, developed, and evaluated a 3D augmented reality
   (AR) weather visualization to investigate whether it could enhance
   communication about weather in general aviation (GA) education.
   Background: Evaluations of GA weather training identified gaps in
   training where students lack the ability to correlate weather knowledge
   to inflight decision making. Literature review: 3D AR learning objects
   have been used in the sciences to make representations of
   multidimensional natural phenomena more accessible in classroom
   settings, and they offer the promise of enhancing communication about
   weather. Research question: Can smartphone- and tablet-based 3D AR
   weather visualizations be effective tools to enhance current GA weather
   education? Methods: A 3D AR thunderstorm cell lifecycle visualization
   was designed and developed. A preliminary evaluation of the application
   for GA weather training was conducted with one certified flight
   instructor, one university aviation meteorology instructor, one
   university thunderstorm expert, and three students to assess whether the
   AR thunderstorm visualization can communicate weather theory and whether
   the interfaces are usable for learning and task completion. Results:
   Students' knowledge of thunderstorms increased after using the
   visualization to explore the dynamics of the thunderstorm lifecycle and
   various aspects of thunderstorms. Experts felt that the learning
   experience met their expectations of what they wanted to communicate
   about thunderstorm theory. The AR interfaces were rated as usable for
   learning interactions and produced low levels of workload. Conclusion:
   The communication of thunderstorm theory was supported by the animation
   and interactivity of the visualization, and has the potential to enhance
   current general aviation weather education.},

Title = {To Entertain or to Serve: Chinese and US Banks' Online Identity Based on
   a Genre Analysis of Social Media},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {Background: Social media, increasingly conceptualized as communicative
   genres, has become a tool for individuals to promote social bonds, as
   well as a platform for corporations to engage with the public and build
   corporate identity. Literature review: Genre analysis has seldom been
   used in investigating social media use and corporate identity
   construction, especially the relationship between corporate identity and
   the interaction of message content and communicative style. Therefore,
   this study intends to implement Lomborg's framework of genre analysis
   for social media studies to compare Weibo posts of Chinese banks with
   Twitter tweets of US banks in terms of thematic orientations (message
   content) and communicative styles (indicated by speech act use) and thus
   examine their corporate identities. Research questions: 1. What thematic
   orientations do Chinese and American banks develop in their
   microblogging messages? 2. What communicative styles do Chinese and
   American banks develop in their microblogging messages? 3. How are
   corporate identities formed through the interaction of thematic
   orientations and communicative styles of the microblogging messages of
   Chinese and American banks? Methodology: We collected posts and tweets
   from the official microblogging accounts of 10 Chinese and US banks on
   the Fortune Global 500 list, identified thematic orientations and
   communicative styles, and conducted a comparative analysis of corporate
   identities based on the interaction of thematic orientations and
   communicative styles. Results and conclusions: In analysis of thematic
   orientations, Chinese banks are more likely to post messages of
   entertainment, operation, and product. In terms of communicative styles,
   their messages are more likely to be characterized by directness,
   inexpressiveness, and independence politeness overall. Specifically,
   they tend to send entertainment posts directly and in the involvement
   politeness style, operation posts indirectly and in the independence
   politeness style, and product posts in the independence politeness
   style. As such, Chinese banks may best be described as the audience's
   friendly companions, objective and authoritative press spokesmen, and
   competitive innovators, a combination that implies values of
   relationship, authority, and competition in collectivism-oriented,
   high-power distance, and high-context cultures. By contrast, US banks
   are more likely to tweet messages of service. Overall, their messages
   are more likely to be characterized by indirectness, expressiveness, and
   involvement politeness. Specifically, they tend to send service tweets
   indirectly and in the involvement politeness style. As such, US banks
   may best be described as financial product sellers and considerate
   service providers, a combination that suggests customer-oriented values
   in individualism and high uncertainty avoidance cultures. In addition,
   both Chinese and US banks claim to be good corporate citizens. This
   comparative analysis sheds light on identity construction and provides
   instructive frameworks for cross-cultural communication on social media
   platforms.},

   instructors have with usability testing? 2. What are their challenges
   with implementing usability testing in technical communication courses?
   3. What are their recommendations for improving their efforts? About the
   case: This study was conducted in 2012 at a small Midwestern university
   where students and instructors in four sections of technical
   communication service courses participated in the study. Situating the
   case: Most technical communication scholarship focuses on usability
   practices, methods, or tools, and rarely explicitly addresses its
   pedagogy, especially the practical challenges faced by our students and
   instructors. Methods/approach: Data were gathered through preliminary
   and post-project student surveys and instructor interviews. Thematic
   coding was used to analyze the data. Results/discussion: Students faced
   the usual practical challenges such as time and resource constraints and
   collaboration with users. They found strategies such as using in-class
   activities, readings, and examples, and working directly with users to
   be helpful in their usability efforts. Instructors expressed the need
   for better preparation. Conclusions: Instructors should not only be
   required to take a usability course that will prepare them to be more
   effective usability instructors, but they should also incorporate
   readings and examples that will help students collaborate effectively
   with users and clients. The study is limited to research participants at
   one institution. Future research should involve larger, ethnographic
   studies of diverse students and instructors to address more aspects of
   usability pedagogy.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Advisory boards provide an opportunity for technical
   communication programs to connect consistently with industry
   practitioners and on-campus stakeholders, and yet few recent studies
   examine best practices for advisory boards in technical communication
   programs. Research questions: (1) What is the typical makeup of a
   technical communication program advisory board? (2) What function do
   these advisory boards serve? (3) What are the typical successes and
   challenges of starting and maintaining a technical communication
   advisory board? (4) What are best practices for starting and maintaining
   a successful advisory board? (5) What are the similarities and
   differences in how program administrators and board members perceive the
   benefits and functions of the board? Literature review: Literature on
   advisory boards in technical and business communication-and in related
   fields such as communication, journalism, and marketing-reports that
   advisory boards are beneficial and effective, though many include
   caveats or recommendations about ways to improve board function.
   Methodology: To provide perspectives from both sides of the
   academy-industry relationship, we conducted 18 semistructured phone,
   Skype, and in-person interviews with program administrators (n = 10)
   from a host of nationwide programs and with board members (n = 8) from a
   single advisory board. Results and discussion: The study finds that the
   typical advisory board involves a mix of industry, faculty, and student
   members, with an emphasis on industry members. They advise the program
   about its curricular concerns, often foster students' academic and
   professional maturation, and support the program in conflicts with
   university administration. The typical successes of advisory boards
   included positive curricular amendment and the recruitment of students
   for jobs and internships, while characteristic challenges included
   meeting logistics and board members' concerns regarding the program's
   response to their advice. Program administrators and board members both
   perceive a board as useful, but some members expressed concern about the
   uncertainty of their role and influence. The results suggest that all
   technical communication programs should seriously consider forming an
   advisory board based on disciplinary best practices, that existing
   advisory boards should ensure that they have clarified the board's role
   for their program, and that stakeholders are aware of and attend to
   their board members' concerns.},

Title = {Learning Beyond the Classroom and Textbook: Client Projects' Role in
   Helping Students Transition From School to Work},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To prepare students for careers postgraduation, many academic programs
   have added components, such as service-learning projects (civic
   oriented, real-audience tasks) and client projects (real-audience
   corporate or nonprofit tasks), which aim to acclimate students to the
   expectations of ``real world{''} clients while they are still in the
   relatively ``safe{''} domain of the classroom. The two studies reported
   in this paper examine whether participating in client projects as part
   of regular technical communication classes aids students in internships
   and later on the job. Research questions: Overall question: How does
   legitimate peripheral participation in client projects give students
   opportunities for learning beyond the end of the client project?
   Literature review: Service-learning and client projects are intended to
   benefit students by offering real-world audiences and complex
   experiences with professional practitioners. Client projects help
   students face these challenges when moving from school to work, such as
   acculturating into the organization or completing tasks designed for
   purposes other than the learner's development. Methodology: To evaluate
   experiences on a particular client project, study one surveyed six
   students with open-ended questions about their experiences on it. To
   explore how the client project prepared them for internships, study two
   used semistructured interviews with interns and supervisors,
   observations of interns at work, and documents that interns created.
   Results and conclusions: Through recursive analysis, client projects
   emerged as being important in students' internship experiences. Students
   participate in client projects in ways that support their learning and
   development as members of a community of practice in internships and on
   the job. This learning is gradual and varied. One particular finding for
   teachers is that rather than shield students from client interactions,
   it may be helpful to promote frequent, structured interactions with
   clients to better prepare students for the workplace.},

Abstract = {Assessing the quality of student efforts and products is a continual
   necessity for academics and practitioners in technical communication;
   however, the process of constructing valid and reliable rubrics remains
   an underexplored topic in the field. This paper first addresses some of
   the assessment concerns and then describes a case study that documents
   the development and implementation of one holistic and five analytic
   rubrics to evaluate undergraduate projects. The discussion focuses on
   identifying site-specific criteria and training effective raters and is
   intended to help academics respond to their required accreditation
   mandates and offer practitioners alternatives for evaluating products
   and services.},

   to guide the design, development, and implementation of health
   information systems for use in rural areas of two developing countries
   in Africa. By using shared conceptual investigation, we are able to
   create a generalized list of stakeholders and values that span multiple
   projects without losing any of the power of the conceptual
   investigation. This process can be applied to other projects to develop
   a stronger set of stakeholders and values. We also present a technical
   investigation of a vaccine delivery project in Sub-Saharan Africa and
   plans for an upcoming empirical investigation for a mobile-phone-based
   support tool for community health workers in East Africa.},

Abstract = {We examine PowerPoint from the point of view of Jean-luc Doumont's
   design guidelines: those for individual slides and those for whole
   presentations. By analyzing two presentations on the same topic,
   designed for two very different audiences, we show that it follows from
   these guidelines that in all cases, fill comprehension requires clearly
   articulated overall organization that integrates the verbal and the
   visual into a single message. This means that the crucial unit of
   analysis is not the individual slide, but the extent to which the
   individual slide is integrated into the presentation as a whole. The
   principle by which this integration is achieved changes as the audience
   does: General audience presentations are best: organized by means of
   narrative, while professional audience presentations are best organized
   by means of argument. In all cases, audience adaptation is the master
   variable, determining what counts as the optimal integration of the
   verbal and the visual into a single message.},

Abstract = {Traceability-the ability of developers to describe and follow the life
   of an artifact throughout the software development life? cycle-is an
   important process that facilitates acquisition and use of process
   knowledge. While there has been extensive research focusing on the
   development of traceability Solutions, there is a paucity of research
   that characterizes the tasks that need to be performed in implementing
   and using traceability. This research addresses this gap by
   conceptualizing traceability practice tit software development us
   comprising information processing and communication among developers
   involved in the process, Accordingly, We present the results of two
   complementary studies focusing on these two aspects of traceability.
   Based on Study 1, we develop a process model for information processing
   in traceability, Through Study 2, we identify important contingency
   factors that impact the mode of communication among developers and
   customers. We argue that choice of communication media should be
   dictated by matching particular media characteristics such as
   synchronicity, reprocessability. and channel capacity to the situation
   at hand rather than by using aggregated measures such as media richness
   or social presence. We integrate the findings,from our two studies into
   a process model that prescribes guidelines for traceability practice in
   software development. Our prescriptions also help traceability tool
   developers in delivering traceability support that facilitates
   appropriate information processing and communication capabilities,
   taking various project characteristics into consideration.},

Abstract = {To optimize learning to write like engineers, undergraduate engineering
   students need to develop a conscious awareness of alternative writing
   practices and their strengths and limitations in different contexts,
   something that is unlikely to come about either in the workplace alone
   or in one writing course alone. Needed, then. is an engineering
   curriculum with writing integrated throughout. What follows is a case
   study of one attempt to integrate writing throughout the curriculum in a
   department of civil and environmental engineering. This department's
   ``beyond WI to department-Wide{''} model of writing is still in the
   early stages; the case study is less a textual account of writing
   outcomes than it is an account of the sociohtstoric institutional
   conditions that led to the creation of this model and of the reasons for
   rejecting a model of writing instruction that relies on only two or
   three writing courses. The model in the case study is contrasted with
   other models.},

Abstract = {This tutorial on how to teach report writing is based on the premise
   that decision-making is a complex process that derives from both
   rational and quasi-rational ways of knowing the world. 7he author
   defines quasi-rational to include consideration of hunches, intuition,
   and tacit knowledge often embodied in stories that have meaning to the
   decision-maker. Thus, report writing can be approached as a systematic
   evaluation of options available given goals and constraints, but also as
   an uncovering of the narratives that decision-makers see surrounding
   their own lives. 7he tutorial explains a course curriculum structured in
   three sections with the following goals and strategies: (1) helping
   students face personal or family decisions through a traditional
   decision-matrix process that also incorporates elements of rhetorical
   stasis theory, (2) using big case studies to reveal the interplay
   between rational and quasi-rational thought in decision-making, and (3)
   finding case studies in the students' local geographic regions in order
   to further explore this interplay. The paper concludes with a brief
   assessment of how the author's students responded to such a course.},

Title = {The functions of formulaic and nonformulaic compliments in interactions

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Writing tutors are encouraged to use compliments in their interactions
   with technical writing students. However the form of compliments
   strongly influences how they function. Specifically, formulaic
   compliments like ``It's good{''} function differently from nonformulaic
   compliments like `The size is excellent in terms of visually aiding the
   reader.{''} A total of 107 compliments were analyzed from 13
   interactions between 12 writing tutors and 12 engineering students.
   About 61\% of tutors' compliments followed one of six formulae, and
   about 39\% were nonformulaic. Formulaic compliments were general and
   mainly performed a phatic function, filling pauses and avoiding silence,
   particularly in interaction closings. Nonformulaic compliments were more
   specific and individualized, and they may, therefore, be more
   instructive thanformulaic compliments. Nonformulaic compliments also
   performed an exploratory function, allowing participants to renegotiate
   discourse status. This study points to other avenues of research,
   particularly research that systemically examines writers' perceptions of
   formulaic and nonformulaic feedback, such as compliments.},

Abstract = {Instant Messaging (IM) features informal writing styles such as the
   omission Of Punctuation. Punctuation plays an important role in
   representing prosody and facilitating syntactic processing during
   communication. The discrepancy between the recognized importance and
   actual inadequate usage of punctuation in IM calls for establishing
   Punctuation convention for more effective online communication. The
   research uniquely reported here addressed two research questions. The
   first Was Whether punctuation had an impact on the effectiveness of IM.
   Me results of an empirical Study showed that the majority of surveyed
   participants perceived punctuation to be somewhat important. This led to
   the investigation of the second research question: how to restore
   omitted punctuation in instant messaging to help develop punctuation
   convention effectively? We designed and implemented a technical solution
   for recovering punctuation based on heuristics rules and an evaluation
   of this approach showed satisfactory performance. A detailed analysis of
   punctuation in archived instant messages revealed several patterns of
   omitted punctuation. The findings of this research not only advance Our
   understanding of the stylistic convention, but also provide positive
   evidence for establishing punctuation convention in IM. As IM continues
   to pervade daily communication, punctuation convention in IM deserves
   closer attention.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore the emergence of subgroups in global virtual
   teams and consider the impact that subgroups have on the communication
   patterns and interactions of these teams. The study presented here takes
   the case of eight virtual teams that were formed between two
   universities in two different countries. Our findings reveal that
   subgroups exert different degrees of impact on the team as a whole.
   Where the impact was high, boundaries were created between team members
   in different subgroups while the development of team cohesiveness was
   restricted. Nevertheless, all teams were able to produce high quality
   outcomes, suggesting that the emergence of subgroups may not always have
   a negative influence on team performance. We discuss the implications of
   these findings for research and practice.},

Abstract = {This article provides a framework for organizing and structuring the
   research of historical researchers who analyze technical and scientific
   publications. Because historical research spans both decades and
   centuries, an effective research methodology is essential, The framework
   consists of a multifaceted 10-step method for studying the written
   discourse of scientific and technical communication, specifically for
   interpreting historical data obtained from articles published in
   technical and scientific journals. The method is a reliable means for
   making sense of the enormous body of data that awaits historical
   researchers in the volumes of scientific and technical discourse already
   published.},

Title = {How Effectively Do We Communicate? An Analysis of Team Reflexivity in
   Transition and Action Phases of Team Collaboration},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {Background: Communication is the backbone of effective collaboration,
   enabling project success; yet, engineering projects often fail due to
   poor communication. Specifically, engineering teams may benefit from
   reflexivity interventions to improve decision making, problem solving,
   innovation, and performance. In this study, we focus on team reflexivity
   in direct application to engineering project management to identify
   reflexivity processes that facilitate effective communication.
   Literature review: Although research has shown that team reflexivity
   interventions-elicited through communication-can improve team
   interaction and performance, little empirical evidence exists into the
   temporal dimensions across the action and transition phases of team
   reflexivity processes. Research questions: 1. How is team reflexivity
   expressed through text-based communication? 2. How and when do team
   members shift between reflexivity processes over time, especially across
   and between transition and action phases? Research methodology: We
   analyzed collaborative activity among 62 four-person teams in a
   computer-simulated microworld across two scenarios. The reflexivity
   processes exhibited during interaction were identified and analyzed
   using statistical and content analysis. Results and discussion: Analyses
   indicated that team reflection promoted discussions about key issues,
   facilitated frequent process shifts among transition and action phases,
   and resulted in overall better performance. Conclusions: Our findings
   demonstrate the importance of team reflexivity interventions in
   engineering project teams to strategically guide members to improve
   planning, responding, and quality of attention devoted to long-term
   outcomes. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the importance of deep
   structured team reflexivity through process shifts to help members
   understand strategies and goals, and develop shared objectives in
   complex environments.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Teachers of English for specific purposes (ESP) face
   challenges when helping engineering students to comprehend
   discipline-specific reading materials because these students have not
   been exposed to engineering reading materials at the secondary-school
   level. This study examines how to best create Science, Technology,
   Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-specific, student-friendly reading
   materials for engineering learners to make the transition from general
   topics to engineering topics comfortable. About the case: Working at
   affiliated colleges of Anna University, Chennai, India, we substituted
   reading materials for those used in textbooks to improve our students'
   receptivity to reading classes. We discuss reading as a skill, the level
   of reading comprehension needed in the engineering context, and its
   relevance to technical and professional communication. Situating the
   case: The study focuses on the need to design materials for the
   engineering classroom. Methods: Our methods include a present-situation
   analysis to examine the challenges that teachers encounter, and analysis
   of qualitative feedback on the reading materials and activities
   introduced in the classroom. Results and discussion: The paper includes
   our experiences in designing reading materials: conducting the
   present-situation analysis, finding and designing appropriate reading
   materials, creating and implementing reading activities, and collecting
   feedback. The responses of the learners indicate that introducing
   STEM-specific material may increase the learners' participation and
   improve their comprehension skills. Conclusion: The study shows that
   STEM-specific, student-friendly reading materials fostered a positive
   attitude and improved, high-level comprehension.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Technical writing is an essential skill set for
   engineering students. Many studies have been conducted, but very few
   have used experimental or quasiexperimental design to identify an
   optimal instructional method in a technical writing class. Situating the
   case: Team-based learning (TBL) is a well-structured learning method
   that prior studies have found to enhance students' academic performance.
   TBL includes individual and collaborative learning activities from lower
   to higher cognitive levels. Peer leadership, as evidenced in other
   studies, uses appointed student leaders to promote equal and active
   group participation and shows a potential to solve the gender issue
   found in engineering class collaborations. About the case: In this case,
   we infused peer leadership in TBL in three technical writing sessions of
   an engineering lab class. Appointed student leaders were responsible for
   initiating and sustaining discussions, asking each group member's input,
   and seeking collective decisions on solutions. The other class used
   traditional TBL activities. Methods/approach: Nonparametric analyses
   were conducted to compare students' technical writing skills and
   self-efficacy, as well as gender differences in two classes.
   Results/discussion: Students in the peer-led TBL class showed better
   technical writing skill retention than their counterparts in the
   traditional TBL class. The gender difference was identified in the
   traditional TBL class. However, we did not find any difference in
   students' self-efficacy between the peer-led and traditional TBL
   sections, though both observed a significant improvement at the end.
   Conclusions: We suggest studies with large sample sizes and equal
   distribution of female and male students.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Building on scholarship and practices in the fields of
   technical and professional communication (TPC), disability studies (DS),
   and legal studies (LS), this article calls for a fusion of these fields
   to help technical and professional communicators (TPCers) negotiate
   legal understandings of access that recognize it as a complex, social
   phenomenon. About the case: To demonstrate such fusion's value in
   interrogating corporate discourse around disability inclusion and
   access, we examine the public-facing documents in JP Morgan Chase \&
   Company's (JP Morgan) diversity and inclusion initiatives. Situating the
   case: Prior cases have traced the impacts of ADA law in transforming
   corporate culture around disability inclusion and access. These cases
   suggest that although the ADA has made significant progress toward
   inclusion and access for disabled employees, it has been limited through
   the influence of normative corporate culture. We thus extend these
   findings through DS. Methods/approach: We use thematic coding to analyze
   a sampling of JP Morgan's disability and inclusion documents to better
   understand their contributions to disability discourse.
   Results/discussion: We identify tensions across four discursive
   expressions, which we recognize both as opportunity spaces for TPCer
   intervention and as justification for integrating TPC, DS, and LS. We
   then offer guidelines for more equitable documentation practices.
   Conclusions: Through the fusion of TPC, DS, and LS, TPCers may engage
   more nuanced understandings of disability and access that support the
   dynamic and relational nature of each.},

Abstract = {About the case: Female entrepreneurs play a significant role in new
   business creation, yet women's entrepreneurship stories remain largely
   absent in professional communication research. Therefore, a need exists
   to ``give voice{''} to female entrepreneurship stories, and this
   exploratory case examines the unique identities that three female
   entrepreneurs express in their narratives. This case asks how three
   female entrepreneurs reconciled the discourses of entrepreneurship,
   gender, and culture to construct a unique entrepreneurial identity in
   their reflective narratives. Situating the case: Professional
   communication has only recently begun to explore entrepreneurship
   communication, and little of that literature explicitly investigates
   women's experiences. This case, by comparison, uses three conceptual
   categories-entrepreneurial identity, gender identity, and cultural
   identity-to explore how three women negotiated their workplace
   identities. Methods: We recruited three women who self-identified as
   technology company entrepreneurs, each from a different culture, and
   recorded their oral narratives about their entrepreneurial journeys.
   Three raters independently coded data drawing on dimensions extracted
   from prior literature to build ``identity curves{''} for each narrative.
   Results: Analysis suggests that each participant negotiated discourses
   of entrepreneurship, gender, and culture differently, with the greatest
   divergence appearing on cultural codes, and the least divergence
   appearing on gender codes. Conclusions: Based on these results, we
   suggest that future research should begin with the assumption that no
   single ``entrepreneurial identity{''} exists for female entrepreneurs,
   and more broadly that professional communication research should
   foreground differences among individuals rather than attempt to
   aggregate individual experiences into homogenous characterizations.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Group projects are a common pedagogical tool for technical
   and professional communication courses. These projects provide students
   with valuable learning experiences that they would not otherwise receive
   working individually. However, student group projects come with some
   unique challenges, such as unequal distribution of work, unequal levels
   of learning, and perceptions of fairness. Situating the case: While many
   instructor-led resources and strategies exist for facilitating group
   projects, fewer student-empowering strategies exist. Data provide one
   potential way to empower students to take ownership of their team
   experience and make more informed decisions throughout the teamwork
   process. About the case: This teaching case was born out of a response
   to the many teamwork problems that are outlined in the literature and
   that the author has observed as an instructor. This teaching case
   describes the implementation and outcomes of a data-driven framework for
   decision making called collect, analyze, triangulate, and act (CAT) that
   the author developed. After they learned about the CATA framework, the
   students completed a series of data-driven exercises during the team
   formation, team functioning, and team evaluation stages of the team
   project. Perceptions of CATA's effectiveness were collected after the
   project ended. Methods: A mixed-methods approach, which included a
   survey and a series of interviews, was used to gain insights into how
   both team members and team leaders perceived the CATA framework.
   Results: Survey results indicated that students found the CATA framework
   helpful in many team contexts. Students expressed particularly strong
   opinions about how CATA aided in the fairness and accuracy of peer
   evaluations, was helpful for self-reflection, and was useful for making
   informed arguments to convince team members of a decision. Interviews
   with team leaders revealed that appealing to data using the CATA
   framework was helpful in managing the team but had limited capacity to
   aid in managing conflict. Conclusions: Students realized many benefits
   from the CATA framework, and some team leaders even felt empowered in
   certain instances by appealing to data. However, instructors should
   still consider scaffolding data literacy and teamwork skills for
   students to be fully prepared for successful teamwork.},

Abstract = {Research questions: This tutorial aims to answer two general questions:
   (1) What contributes to search engine rankings? and (2) What can web
   content creators and webmasters do to make their content and sites
   easier to find by audiences using search engines? Key concepts: Search
   engines' rankings are shaped by three classes of participants: search
   engine companies and programmers, search engine optimization
   practitioners, and search engine users. Key lessons: By applying three
   key lessons, professional communicators can make it easier for audiences
   to find their web content through search engines: (1) consider their web
   content's audiences and website's competitors when analyzing keywords;
   (2) insert keywords into web text that will appear on search engine
   results pages, and (3) involve their web content and websites with other
   web content creators. Implications: Because successful search engine
   optimization requires considerable time, professional communicators
   should progressively apply these lessons in the sequence presented in
   this tutorial and should keep up to date with frequently changing
   ranking algorithms and with the associated changing practices of search
   optimization professionals.},

Title = {TIP-EXE: A Software Tool for Studying the Use and Understanding of
   Procedural Documents},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {106-121},

Abstract = {Research problem: When dealing with procedural documents, individuals
   sometimes encounter comprehension problems due to poor information
   design. Researchers studying the use and understanding of procedural
   documents, as well as technical writers charged with the design of these
   documents, or usability specialists evaluating their quality, would all
   benefit from tools allowing them to collect real-time data concerning
   user behavior in user-centered studies. With this in mind, the generic
   software Technical Instructions Processing-Evaluations and eXperiments
   Editor (TIP-EXE) was designed to facilitate the carrying out of such
   studies. Research questions: Does document design, and specifically the
   matching or mismatching of the terms employed in a user manual and on
   the corresponding device, affect the cognitive processes involved in the
   comprehension of procedural instructions? Can we use a software tool
   like TIP-EXE to assess the impact of document design on the use and
   understanding of a procedural document? Literature review: A review of
   the methods employed to study either the use of procedural documents or
   their cognitive processing, and to evaluate the quality of these
   documents, revealed the lack of tools for collecting relevant data.
   Methodology: TIP-EXE software was used to set up and run a laboratory
   experiment designed to collect data concerning the effect of document
   design on the performance of a task. The experiment was conducted with
   36 participants carrying out tasks involving the programming of a
   digital timer under one of three conditions: ``matching
   instructions,{''} ``mismatching instructions,{''} ``mismatching
   instructions + picture{''}. Based on a click-and-read method for blurred
   text, TIP-EXE was used to collect data on the time the users spent
   reading the instructions, as well as the time spent handling the timer.
   Results and discussion: Results show that ``matching instructions{''}
   (when the terms employed in the user manual match the terms on the
   device) enhance user performance. This instructional format results in
   less time spent consulting the instructions and handling the device, as
   well as fewer errors. This research shows that TIP-EXE software can be
   used to study the way in which operating instructions are read, and the
   time spent consulting specific information contained therein, thereby
   revealing the effects of document design on user behavior.},

Abstract = {Engineering programs in the US made notable efforts to develop students'
   intercultural competence, but they tended to overlook the teaching of
   intercultural communication. Technical communication teachers can fill
   this gap by addressing intercultural issues in the service class. This
   proposal faces challenges: the lack of class time, teacher training,
   textbooks, and teaching methods. To address these challenges, this
   tutorial uses various materials and genre-based instruction to integrate
   intercultural communication into the service class. This approach helps
   to raise students' intercultural awareness and sensitivity as they learn
   engineering communication genres. This tutorial may be used in service
   classes for other majors.},

Abstract = {This study on computer-mediated deception features an experiment
   involving an interactive interview of deceitful applicants for a
   fictitious scholarship, using one of three different computer-based
   communication media. Results showed that people were successful at
   deceiving others no matter what medium was used, but interviewers who
   used interactive, as opposed to non-interactive, media probed
   interviewees more during the interviews. Probing led to better lie
   detection. Also, interviewers who had received simple warnings about the
   possible presence of deception were better at detecting deception than
   were interviewers who had received no warnings. However, warnings alone
   were not sufficient to increase interviewers' probing.},

Abstract = {Early studies of electronic journals (e journals) viewed the web as a
   technological discontinuity that would deem traditional academic
   publishing null. This article uses the industry life cycle framework as
   a lens to examine the formation of academic e journals. The article
   proposes five factors affecting the academic publishing dominant design
   selection process, and examines these factors against six longitudinal
   case studies. The study concludes that from technical/functional,
   economic and market perspectives, e journals are superior to paper
   journals (p journals). However, academic social norms and the managerial
   processes needed to establish and maintain e journals are more
   influential on their formation than the capabilities provided by the new
   technology. In addition, the long-term sustainability and survivability
   of e journals depend on the administrative and managerial processes
   established by its management team. This study demonstrates that
   although the web enables a large number of new entrants and a variety of
   business and technical models, e journals are a competency-enhancing
   innovation that relies on the existing expertise of professional
   publishers and the journal's ability to support the social and cultural
   needs of academia.},

Abstract = {Our view of ethics in professional and technical communication has
   evolved, paralleling developments throughout society. Earlier views on
   ethics and values have grown into a broad perspective of complex
   gradations with people at many levels affecting eventual practical
   outcomes. This newer perspective includes not only persons but social
   forces and organizations. The organizational culture of NASA, for
   example, was specifically identified by the Columbia Accident
   Investigation Board (CAIB) as one of the causes of faulty communication
   leading to a terribly tragic event. The Challenger investigations of 20
   years earlier, on the other hand, focused primarily on physical events,
   secondarily on professional judgments, and only little on the social and
   cultural context of the disaster. We learn by failures but also by
   self-examination. As we see how ethics and values impact technical
   events, we understand that technological progress is ultimately a human
   endeavor in which reflection and judgment is as important as measurement
   and observation.},

Abstract = {Technical communicators can and should play an important role in the
   development of information systems to improve the usability of the
   systems. Besides writing user guides and training material, technical
   communicators can engage in four other tasks to add value to information
   systems development: acting as user advocate, writing online help,
   writing system and error messages, and providing advice on interface
   design. We assert that technical communicators' involvement in systems
   development should not be tied to a particular development methodology.
   Instead, they should be associated with four general tasks in systems
   development: system investigation, analysis, design, and implementation.
   We then discuss some notable human factors and their impacts on the
   tasks performed by technical communicators. Three cognitive mapping
   techniques-causal mapping, semantic mapping, and concept mapping-are
   introduced as a means to elicit an individual's belief system regarding
   a problem domain. These cognitive mapping techniques have great
   potential for overcoming some behavioral and cognitive problems as well
   as facilitating understanding among stakeholders in the development of
   information systems. We discuss how technical communicators can apply
   various cognitive mapping techniques to improve the usability of the
   resulting information systems. The use of these techniques is
   illustrated using a case study.},

Abstract = {This study used a qualitative methodology to examine how discourse norms
   and socialization processes affect the development of technical
   requirements. Our exploratory investigation of how government personnel
   develop and review technical requirements indicates that discourse norms
   and academic technical writing socialization processes affect the
   technical writing process. Technical writers perceived that requirements
   in work statements became less precise as more requirements were
   coordinated in team-based designs. In essence, we found that in
   team-based designs, INTERPRETATION CONFLICT and TECHNICAL DIFFUSION were
   important dimensions when writing and coordinating technical
   requirements. Our findings suggest that collaborative technical writing
   is a complex and difficult process in team-based designs where
   integration and persuasion skills dominate.},

Abstract = {In virtual teams, members are physically distributed and often have not
   met each other in person. They work together and share information via
   electronic communication. To address business problems in a timely way,
   virtual teams must quickly become effective upon formation. However,
   prior studies have found that virtual teams are ineffective initially
   because electronic communication does not facilitate building of shared
   understanding among team members. This study proposes a dialogue
   technique that facilitates building of shared understanding in virtual
   teams. Results from an experiment showed that virtual teams which used
   this technique had better relational development and decision outcome
   than those which did not. Moreover, these differences remained over
   time. Therefore, the dialogue technique appears to be useful for helping
   virtual teams become effective quickly so as to address business
   problems without unnecessary delays.},

Abstract = {Background: An organization's internal communication is an important
   factor shaping employees' organizational commitment. Internal
   communication practices can be classified into three types according to
   the direction of information flow: top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal
   communication. Research questions: 1. What are the relationships between
   the three types of internal communication and organizational commitment?
   2. Are there any mediating routes that bridge the relationship between
   internal communication and organizational commitment? 3. Do the effects
   of internal communication on organizational commitment vary for
   different jobs? Literature review: Based on the social exchange theory,
   we uncover the underlying mechanism of the relationships between the
   three types of internal communication and organizational commitment.
   Methodology: A structural equation model using partial least squares was
   employed to analyze survey data from 12,817 full-time employees in the
   Chinese internet sector. Results and conclusions: The results suggest
   that top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal communication affect
   organizational commitment positively and significantly via the mediating
   routes of employees' perceived job attractiveness or perceived customer
   service performance. The study also reveals a fit between employees' job
   characteristics (e.g., information-processing demands) and internal
   communication types to improve organizational commitment. These findings
   generate theoretical and practical implications for professional
   communication management.},

Title = {Using a Transfer-Focused Writing Pedagogy to Improve Undergraduates' Lab
   Report Writing in Gateway Engineering Laboratory Courses},

Abstract = {Background: The lab report is a commonly assigned genre in engineering
   lab courses; however, students often have difficulties meeting the
   expectations of writing in engineering labs. At the same time, it is
   challenging for engineering faculty to instruct lab report writing
   because they are often under-supported in writing pedagogies and usually
   unfamiliar with the extent of students' prior writing knowledge.
   Literature review: Literature on technical communication in engineering
   addresses the importance of a rhetorical approach to writing
   instruction, as well as an emphasis on genre. Extending this literature,
   research into writing transfer provides valuable insight for better
   understanding how undergraduates negotiate the engineering lab report as
   a new genre within this distinct rhetorical context. Research questions:
   1. How effective is a transfer-focused writing pedagogy in supporting
   students' understanding of the genre conventions of engineering lab
   reports? 2. How does the transfer-focused writing pedagogy impact
   students' writing quality in five categories (rhetorical knowledge,
   organization, evidence, critical thinking, and disciplinary
   conventions)? 3. What are the rhetorical features that engineering
   students improve or struggle with the most with lab report writing?
   Research methodology: Four engineering instructors and two English
   instructors participated in this study to design and develop the lab
   report writing instructional module, and implemented the module
   materials into their engineering lab courses. The module, consisting of
   lab report writing instruction and assessment resources, shares a
   rhetorical approach and foundational writing terms with first-year
   composition courses to emphasize a writing-transfer pedagogy. We
   collected and analyzed undergraduates' lab report samples to evaluate
   the impact of the module on students' writing performance. Two sets of
   lab reports were collected for analysis: the sample sets before
   (control), during the 2015-2016 academic year; and after (experimental)
   implementation of the module, during the 2016-2017 academic year.
   Results and conclusions: Data collected via pre- and post-implementation
   writing artifacts show that a rhetorical approach to teaching lab
   reports helped students better understand the expectations of the lab
   report as a discipline-specific genre, and it developed students'
   understanding of the rhetorical features of engineering writing. The
   pilot module positively impacted the quality of students' lab reports, a
   finding that suggests that using a transfer-focused writing pedagogy can
   successfully support the transfer and adaptation of writing knowledge
   into gateway or entry-level engineering laboratory courses.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Technical and professional communication (TPC) instructors
   value audience awareness, using peer- and client-based projects to
   facilitate it. We explore how students' audience awareness is
   facilitated by the case method, which presents students with a
   professional communication task within a workplace scenario. Situating
   the case: Case-method research suggests including a detailed audience
   and situation, multiple genres, and multimedia. Few studies have
   explored how case materials facilitate students' audience awareness.
   About the case: A 12-week case that was consistent with case-method
   research asked students to respond to an engineering firm's internal
   problem with a proposal and report. How the case was studied: Students
   from two sections of a genre-based course completed reflections about
   their audience awareness after the proposal and report. We qualitatively
   analyzed 51 reflections. Results/discussion: Students stated they could
   understand the facts about their primary audience but couldn't identify
   secondary and tertiary audiences. Students stated they could identify
   audience needs, but they disagreed about the amount of detail to
   understand those needs. Also, students stated they could respond to the
   audience using appropriate evidence and writing style. Conclusions: When
   using the case method, instructors should know that students may need
   varying levels of detail to interpret their audience's needs. Also,
   including data and conflicting needs gives students opportunities to
   make strategic decisions about content.},

Abstract = {Background: This study investigates linguistic characterizations in the
   form of linguistic co-occurrence patterns in discussion sections of
   English research articles (RAs) in an engineering discipline (i.e.,
   chemical engineering) and linguistic variations that distinguish
   discussion sections of high-impact articles from those in low-impact
   articles. Research questions: 1. What underlying linguistic
   characterizations are salient in RA discussions in chemical engineering?
   2. Are there any differences in the identified linguistic
   characterizations of discussion sections between high- and low-impact
   RAs? Literature review: In the process of composing RAs, the discussion
   section is a difficult and challenging part-genre to write. The
   rhetorical organization of RA discussions has been examined extensively
   through Swales's English for Specific Purposes genre analysis. However,
   the linguistic characterizations of RA discussion sections remain
   unclear and the question of whether discernible differences exist
   between discussions of high- and low-impact RAs in a specialized
   engineering discipline remains unanswered. Methodology: This study used
   Biber's multidimensional (MD) analysis method. In response to the first
   research question, factor analysis (in this study, principal component
   analysis) was adopted to identify the linguistic characterizations in
   the form of linguistic co-occurrence patterns ({''}dimensions{''}) in
   213 RA discussion sections extracted from chemical engineering RAs. To
   answer the second question, the independent t-test was implemented to
   compare the high- and low-impact RA discussion sections in the
   identified dimensions. Results and conclusions: Six linguistic
   characterizations in the form of linguistic co-occurrence patterns were
   identified in RA discussion sections: 1. involvement and interactivity,
   2. non-narration versus narration, 3. evaluative statements with further
   explanations and elaborations, 4. informational density, 5. stating
   results/ claims, and 6. expression of denial relationships toward
   statement or experimental findings. The results suggest the linguistic
   characterizations in RA discussion sections and interesting differences
   in the high- and low-impact RA discussion sections, especially in
   Dimensions 1, 3, and 5. Reasons for the linguistic variations in the
   identified dimensions are discussed, followed by the pedagogical
   implications for reading or writing RAs for international scientific
   communication.},

Abstract = {Teaching problem: The comparative/contrastive approach to teaching
   intercultural communication is based on the premise that global
   rhetorical practices are not mere indicators of the cultural
   proclivities of a people, but are also a framework for developing a
   working knowledge about how members of a culture communicate. However,
   this approach predisposes learners to contrasting those cultures against
   their own and reinforces their preconceptions about national cultural
   characteristics. Augmenting that approach with
   transliteracies-emphasizing the benefits of knowledge sourcing not
   limited to scholarly/ academic sources-offers a multidimensional
   perspective to intercultural communication. Research question: How can
   transliteracy inquiry be applied in teaching and learning global
   rhetorics? Situating the case: The approaches described here draw on the
   work of literacy researchers who delineate ways in which transliteracy
   broadens the scope of learning materials, including texts that are
   cultural and social (as opposed to linguistic) and that can be studied
   for what they convey about those cultures. How the case was studied:
   This paper describes the experience of using transliteracies to teach
   intercultural professional communication. The material was collected
   informally over the course of two years of teaching the course through
   observation, student completed research reports, and reflections. About
   the case: The shortcomings of contrastive and comparative rhetoric
   pedagogy in intercultural communication may be due in part to
   instructional materials selection and prioritization of what teachers
   deem to be scholarly. Reasoning that the basic architecture of a global
   rhetorics lies in its surrounding culture, artifacts, and communication
   systems, I designed an assignment that required students to describe how
   one culture's heritage, history, governmental systems, and value systems
   contribute to the development of persuasion and uses of rhetoric.
   Results: Transliteracies opened up spaces that allowed students to gain
   an in-depth understanding of others' rhetorical practices without
   contrasting them against their own and by approaching them as
   ethnographic objects of study. Students engaged the object of their
   scholarship more expansively. Conclusions: Transliteracies in
   intercultural professional communication sewed to move students toward a
   more immersive and empathetic understanding of referent cultures, a
   stance that enriches professional communication. Students displayed a
   more altruistic value system in representing their objects of study and
   were careful to recognize that their work might be accessed by a wider
   audience. Transliteracies offer a practical toolkit for comprehending
   and fashioning understandable and compelling arguments about other
   cultures.},

Abstract = {Background: Our teaching case reports on a fieldwork assignment designed
   to have master of arts students experience first-hand how entrepreneurs
   write for the globalized marketplace by examining public displays of
   language, such as billboards, shop windows, and posters. Research
   questions: How do entrepreneurs use English to ``style{''} themselves?
   What is the status of English in public displays? Which relationship
   with customers is cultivated by using English (among other languages)?
   How does English, or lookalike versions thereof, create a more
   innovative business? Situating the case: We use linguistic landscaping
   (LL) as a pedagogical resource, drawing on similar cases in a local
   English as a foreign language (EFL) community in Oaxaca, Mexico; EFL
   programs in Chiba-shi, Japan; francophone and immersion French programs
   in Montreal, QC, Canada and Vancouver, BC, Canada; and a study of the
   entrepreneurial landscape in Observatory's business corridor of Lower
   Main Road in Cape Town, South Africa. How this case was studied: We
   interviewed 36 students about their learning process in one-to-one post
   hoc interviews. Recurrent themes were increased self-monitoring,
   improved professional communication literacy, and expanded real-world
   understanding. About the case: The teaching case follows a three-pronged
   approach. First, we have students decide on a survey area, determine
   their empirical focus, establish analytical units, decide how to collect
   data, collect (sociodemographic) information about their survey area,
   and determine the degree of researcher engagement. Next, students
   conduct fieldwork, documenting the linguistic landscape in small teams
   of three to four students. In the third phase, students have returned
   from the field and discuss their initial findings, ideas, and
   observations during a data session with the instructors. Students decide
   whether they still stand by the decisions they made before they entered
   the field and are then asked to qualify how language is used in public
   space. Results: The main takeaway of the assignment is that students
   were more aware of the degree of linguistic innovation, rhetorical
   creativity, and ethnocultural stereotyping of entrepreneurial
   communication in their cities. Conclusion: As a pedagogical tool, LL
   offers possibilities for exploring entrepreneurial communication in all
   of its breadth and variety, providing access to perhaps the most visible
   and creative materialities of entrepreneurs and service providers: shop
   windows and signs.},

Title = {The Role of Relational Familiarity When Interpreting Family Business
   Communication},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research problem: This study investigates the difference in perceptions
   within the family-owned businesses of messages received from family
   members and outsiders to assess the role that relational familiarity
   (the amount of prior experience two people share communicating with each
   other) plays in internal business communication in these settings.
   Previous research has shown that this relational familiarity-along with
   experience with the communicative medium, the message topic, and the
   business context-lead to channel expansion (the ability to reduce
   uncertainty from a message with limited communicative cues) for business
   communicators. But the impact of relational familiarity on communication
   competence and personal biases between family members-which could impact
   the ability of relational familiarity to achieve its intended goals-has
   yet to be fully explored. Research questions: (1) Does increased
   relational familiarity between communicators lead to increased
   perceptions of message effectiveness and appropriateness in lean media
   settings? (2) In family business settings where familial biases may be
   prevalent, is increased relational familiarity linked to perceptions of
   increased sender likeability and lowered message negativity? Literature
   review: Channel Expansion Theory, which proposes that communicators can
   overcome the limitations of a medium by using their personal experience,
   guides this study. Previous research found that with personal experience
   with the communicator sending the message, a message receiver can
   enhance the limited capacity of a medium to convey cues that aid in
   understanding the message. Four perceptual variables-message
   effectiveness, message appropriateness, message negativity, sender
   likeability-result in benefits accrued from channel expansion and
   relational familiarity, such as reduced uncertainty and equivocality
   about the message topic. Methodology: A quasiexperimental setting was
   designed to elicit messages from business co-workers using email.
   Message senders were instructed to describe the same business problem in
   order for the recipient to understand the problem and decide how to
   proceed. Eighty-three family business owners, managers, and employees
   received one message from a family member belonging to the same business
   and one message assigned at random from a nonfamily member working
   elsewhere (a stranger). The 83 message receivers were asked to complete
   instruments measuring their perceptions of the messages. Results and
   conclusions: Results suggested that the relational familiarity between
   communicators played a significant role in improving message
   effectiveness and message appropriateness. Sender likeability was also
   enhanced when family members correctly identified the source of the
   message. The findings suggest that family members can benefit from
   channel expansion, though not as many members as expected, and that
   complex problem and task descriptions were communicated using lean media
   (communication channels that inhibit sending messages infused with
   communicative cues) and are perceived as most effective when described
   by familiar others.},

Abstract = {This study explores the characteristics of authors who have published in
   technical communication journals between 2008 and 2012 to generate
   insights into who is actively contributing to scholarship in the field.
   These insights drive a broader discussion regarding programmatic
   implications and interdisciplinary approaches to research. Research
   questions: (1) Who is publishing in technical communication journals? In
   which departments are they housed and in which departments did they
   receive their Ph. D. training? (2) What relationship exists between an
   author's departments (current and Ph. D.) and the publication venues he
   or she chooses? (3) What relationship exists between an author's
   department (current and Ph. D.) and the type of research he or she
   produces? (4) What relationship exists between an author's department
   (current and Ph. D.) and collaboratively authored articles? Also, is
   there a relationship between doctoral training outside the US and
   collaboratively authored articles? (5) Among authors with Ph. D.'s in
   technical communication, is there a relationship between doctoral
   program and research output (collaboratively authored articles and
   research method)? Literature review: All disciplines, especially
   maturing disciplines, must examine and evaluate the research its
   scholars produce in order to identify trends that signal growth and
   areas that require additional growth. Previous research indicates that
   departments in which people trained and where they work influence the
   research profiles of individuals, and by extension, the field. This is
   particularly true in technical communication, whose research features a
   plurality of methods, a positive attribute of the field. However, an
   uneven distribution of research methods used in the field also presents
   potential areas for growth. Methodology: A data set of 674 authors who
   have published in the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION
   (TPC), Technical Communication Quarterly, and Journal of Business and
   Technical Communication (JBTC), between 2008 and 2012 was coded for
   current department, Ph. D. department, department with a technical
   communication degree program, research method, and collaboratively
   authored articles. Data were analyzed using contingency table analysis
   and correspondence analysis. Results and discussion: Authors from
   English departments constitute nearly 30\% of the sample; authors from
   information systems and technology departments and management, business,
   and economics departments made up more than 20\% of the total sample. A
   little over 20\% of the sample received a Ph. D. degree in technical
   communication. Authors from information systems and technology
   departments and management, business, and economics departments are
   highly associated with TPC. Authors from English departments and writing
   departments were associated with TCQ and JBTC. TC is associated with
   authors from education departments and human-centered design
   departments. Authors from information systems and technology departments
   and management, business, and economics departments were associated with
   surveys and experiments. Authors from English departments were
   associated with case study and mixed methods research. Non-US authors
   and ones from engineering, computer science, linguistics, information
   systems and technology, and management, business, and economics
   departments were all highly associated with collaboratively authored
   articles.
   These results provide insights into which disciplines are most
   influential and opportunities to consider the approaches and training of
   our diverse population of scholars in an effort to build a cohesive body
   of research. The results are limited by the time frame of the study, and
   future studies could examine a more extensive sample to examine shifts
   in authorship characteristics over time.},

Abstract = {Technical writers and translators struggle with language consistency in
   emerging technologies. Corpus linguistics can track language structures
   in such quickly developing environments. An ad-hoc corpus may be the
   tool needed for technical communicators. Key concepts: Mega-corpora
   versus ad-hoc corpora: The term ``mega-corpora{''} typically covers the
   existing national corpora, whereas ad-hoc corpora can be created quickly
   for technical communication. Variation versus consistency: variation
   covers the range of possible solutions compared to the need for
   consistency of terminology in given contexts. Representativeness versus
   adequacy: representativeness defines the possibility of variation within
   the scope of the field; in contrast, adequacy represents contextual
   suitability. Key lessons: To use ad-hoc corpora as a tool for keeping
   track of and understanding language variation in texts about emerging
   technology: (1) design and compile a small set of relevant descriptions
   regarding the emerging technology, (2) use the software corpus tool
   representation of corpora to evaluate whether the ad-hoc corpus is
   representative-meaning that adding new texts does not add new words or
   variations in terminology use, (3) use the software corpus tool AntConc
   to analyze the ad-hoc corpus finding concordance patterns and variation
   in terminology usage, and (4) use linguistic strategies for selecting
   terminology based on linguistic evidence rather than intuition.
   Implications for practice: The ad-hoc corpus method offers an
   evidence-based approach for determining patterns of terminology. This
   method can be applied to standardizing product documentation or tracking
   variations in language use and can help technical writers and
   translators keep track of evolving terminology for emerging
   technologies.},

Abstract = {Problem: This teaching case presents the authors' experience planning,
   teaching, and evaluating a semester-long course within a computer
   science undergraduate program; the aim of this course was to develop
   soft skills that enable students to actively contribute within
   multicultural and transdisciplinary teams. Research question: How can an
   undergraduate-level course help computer science students better
   understand the multicultural and interdisciplinary scenarios that
   compose today's working environment? Situating the case: The literature
   review contextualizes the case as part of a broader group of literature
   concerned with curricular reforms that replace the traditional emphasis
   on memorization of fixed disciplinary knowledge with what have been
   called ``21st Century Skills.{''} In addition, it builds a theoretical
   framework followed by the course that brings together Hofstede's
   Cultural Theory and Vygotsky's ideas regarding the social formation of
   the mind. Methodology: The researchers conducted two studies with a
   group of 62 students who participated in the course. The first one
   measured how students appropriated the concepts presented in the course
   and learning outcomes. The second one evaluated the students' perception
   of the course a year after they had enrolled in it. About the teaching
   case: Results show that the vast majority of students appropriate the
   concepts of the theoretical framework used throughout the course. In
   addition, most students perceive the courses' contribution to their
   professional lives positively-particularly regarding understanding
   cultural and transdisciplinary issues. A small group does not consider a
   course like the one proposed to be useful. Conclusions: The implication
   of this teaching case is that the ability to communicate effectively
   with a range of audiences is something that can be addressed directly by
   a specifically designed course within a computer science curriculum
   (rather than exclusively being a secondary outcome of other courses).
   The limitations of the study are that it presents the authors' own
   teaching experience (therefore, it is not a third-party report) and that
   it uses pretesting and posttesting as an asessment tool for
   multicultural and transdisciplinary abilities. Future work would show
   how similar experiences could be conducted across other cultural
   scenarios and possible ways in which to engage the small group of
   students who do not consider the course useful.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a 10-year case study at a Chinese university of a
   faculty team's attempt to develop and disseminate a project-based
   computer-assisted language learning (CALL) program for professional
   communication. The discussion focuses on three main challenges
   (professional/academic values, pedagogical philosophy, and institutional
   culture) to expand a project-based CALL program at this university.
   Based on the findings, this paper discusses how the implementation of
   project-based CALL for professional communication needs to be founded
   upon a good understanding of China's sociocultural contexts and how it
   might be tailored in order to be more responsive to the local university
   context. This paper concludes by suggesting a path that practitioners
   might take in light of these circumstances and challenges.},

Abstract = {This three-phased study examines corporate blog use, specifically the
   impact and value of blogs on organizational social capital and knowledge
   sharing at Dell Inc., a global computer manufacturer. The impact of
   social-mediated Web 2.0 technologies on organizational social capital
   has received limited attention in scholarship, possibly because of the
   inevident connection to measurable economic value and newness of the
   technology. Our findings indicate the corporate blog can be used as a
   sustainable forum leading to a shared understanding of organizational
   roles, increased sense of group cohesiveness, improved work processes,
   and improved professional and personal ties among employees in the

Abstract = {Business case studies have been a standard pedagogical tool in technical
   communication classrooms. However, the expansion of engineering
   practice-including the design and implementation of appropriate
   technology in the developing world-suggests the need to complement such
   studies. This paper analyzes three business and three humanitarian case
   studies. It highlights the complexities of audience and context that
   distinguish the humanitarian case studies, and it argues that
   incorporating humanitarian cases into technical communication courses
   would promote higher levels of learning, student engagement, and the
   global citizenship that will be requisite for all engineers in the

   engineering faculty and graduate students how to write micro-insertions
   for graduate engineering courses, with particular attention to how the
   grant develops engineering students' (and faculty members') ability to
   communicate across disciplinary boundaries. We also describe previous
   and planned methods for assessing the effectiveness of micro-insertions.
   Finally, we explain the role that technical communication faculty and
   graduate students are playing us part of the grant team, specifically in
   developing art Ethics In-Basket that will disseminate micro-insertions

Volume = {46},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Communication skills are crucial to the successful completion of an
   information system (IS) project. The ability to interact with all
   potential stakeholders in an organization, to clearly document
   requirements, and to effectively express ideas has long been recognized
   by researchers and practitioners as critical success factors. This study
   examines how communication skills of IS professionals during a
   development project are viewed by three different stakeholders.
   Specifically, each of three stakeholder groups is examined to determine
   the extent to which a gap between expectations and perceived performance
   leads to lower satisfaction of the system of the users, lower perceived
   job performance by IS managers, or less career satisfaction for the IS
   professionals. A matched survey indicates that user satisfaction and job
   performance ratings by managers are related to a perceived failure to
   meet expectations, but that IS professionals do not relate career
   satisfaction directly to a lack in these skills. Organizations looking
   for success in the IS function must take steps to improve the
   communication skills of the IS professionals to the level expected by
   other stakeholders.},

Title = {The Effect of Message Repetition on Information Diffusion on Twitter: An
   Agent-Based Approach},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {66},

Pages = {150-169},

Abstract = {Background: Twitter offers tools that facilitate the diffusion of
   information by which companies can engage consumers to share their
   messages. Literature review: Communication professionals are using
   platforms such as Twitter to disseminate information; however, the
   strategies that they should use to achieve high information diffusion
   are not clear. This article proposes message repetition as a strategy.
   Research questions: 1. What is the wear-out point of Twitter? 2. How
   many times should a company repeat a tweet written on its brand page to
   maximize the diffusion for seeds? 3. How many times should a company
   repeat a tweet written on its brand page to maximize the diffusion while
   minimizing the number of consumers reaching their wear-out point for
   seeds? 4. How many times should a company repeat a tweet written on its
   brand page to maximize the diffusion for nonseeds? 5. How many times
   should a company repeat a tweet written on its brand page to maximize
   the diffusion while minimizing the number of consumers reaching their
   wear-out point for both seeds and nonseeds? Research methodology: An
   agent-based simulation model for information diffusion is proposed as an
   approach to measure the diffusion of a tweet that has been repeated. The
   model considers that consumers can reach their wear-out point when they
   read a tweet several times. Results: The results of the model indicate
   the number of times a company should send the same tweet to achieve high
   information diffusion before this action has negative effects on
   consumers. Brand followers are key to achieving high information
   diffusion; however, consumers begin to feel bothered by the tweet by the
   sixth repetition. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first study to examine tweet repetition as a strategy to achieve higher
   information diffusion on Twitter. In addition, it extends the
   information diffusion literature by controlling the wear-out effect. It
   contributes to both communication and computational science literature
   by analyzing a communication problem using an agent-based approach.
   Finally, this article contributes to the field of technical and
   professional communication by testing a strategy to reach great
   information diffusion, and by creating a tool that any company can use
   to anticipate the results of a communication campaign created in Twitter
   before launching it.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Online learning and work are commonplace in both
   engineering and professional communication. To be effective online, even
   experienced face-to-face teachers require new skills. About the case:
   This case reports on the design and delivery of faculty training on
   teaching online at a Norwegian university during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Two questions are examined: 1. What topics and training designs are
   suitable for beginning online teachers with little time to implement the
   results of the training? 2. In this emergency context, how do local
   conditions impact the design and delivery of such training? The training
   focused on building interactive online courses, providing formative
   feedback for students, and choosing between synchronous and asynchronous
   teaching. Situating the case: The literature suggests that teachers
   often undergo a shift in their teaching philosophies and methods when
   transitioning to online environments. Methods/approach: Pretraining and
   post-training reflection were used as informal data sources to develop
   the training sessions and to holistically discuss the themes that
   emerged from the training. Results/discussion: Two online and one
   face-to-face 2-hour training sessions were delivered to three groups of
   faculty. Three main themes emerged from the training: active learning,
   synchronous/asynchronous teaching, and providing formative feedback to
   students. Conclusions: Challenges included convincing participants to
   shift from the lecture as the main method of instruction to more
   interactive and active techniques, as well as reconciling the
   standardized course study plans with individual teachers' instructional
   needs. Larger studies of training programs and more formal methods of
   data analysis are suggested.},

Title = {The Generic Structure of CSR Reports in Italian, Chinese, and English: A
   Corpus-Based Analysis},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {60},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: This study examines the generic structure of corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) reports, which are becoming standard
   practice for corporate communication of social and environmental
   performance beyond financial disclosure. Literature review: Genre
   theories provide a framework for exploring genres contextualized in
   different cultures. Based on the English for Specific Purposes approach
   of genre analysis, this study compares the move structure of CSR reports
   in Italian, Chinese, and English from a corpus-based perspective.
   Research questions: 1. What are the main moves used in CSR reports? 2.
   Are there any cross-cultural similarities or variations in terms of
   generic features? Methodology: Combining genre theories with concepts
   from Systemic Functional Linguistics, we designed an observational
   framework for move identification. Based on a 15-move scheme, we
   annotated 18 CSR reports for comparative analysis. Results and
   conclusions: The CSR report is characterized by rhetorical recursivity
   and hybridity of speech acts: beyond ``reporting{''} and
   ``presenting,{''} it is also ``demonstrating,{''} `` evaluating,{''} and
   ``committing.{''} As a globally established genre, it presents
   noticeable generic similarity in different languages, suggesting that
   the communicative purposes of CSR reports are recognized by different
   cultures. The top six moves in the Performance-reporting section of the
   CSR reports present identical trends in terms of extensiveness ranking
   in all three languages. Cross-cultural variations mainly involve the use
   of optional moves, such as the dominant use of the move ``Presenting
   individual cases{''} in the Chinese sample. The observational framework
   for move identification may also be transferable to other genres. The
   limitations of this study include the sample size and the absence of an
   author survey. Future research could investigate the CSR report from a
   diachronic perspective, to explore how its genre structure has developed
   over time.},

Title = {A Study of How Information System Professionals Comprehend Indirect and
   Direct Speech Acts in Project Communication},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {226-241},

Abstract = {Research problem: Indirect communication is prevalent in business
   communication practices. For information systems (IS) projects that
   require professionals from multiple disciplines to work together, the
   use of indirect communication may hinder successful design,
   implementation, and maintenance of these systems. Drawing on the Speech
   Act Theory (SAT), this study investigates how direct and indirect speech
   acts may influence language comprehension in the setting of
   communication problems inherent in IS projects. Research questions: (1)
   Do participating subjects, who are IS professionals, differ in their
   comprehension of indirect and direct speech acts? (2) Do participants
   display different attention processes in their comprehension of indirect
   and direct speech acts? (3) Do participants' attention processes
   influence their comprehension of indirect and direct speech acts?
   Literature review: We review two relevant areas of theory-polite speech
   acts in professional communication and SAT. First, a broad review that
   focuses on literature related to the use of polite speech acts in the
   workplace and in information system (IS) projects suggests the
   importance of investigating speech acts by professionals. In addition,
   the SAT provides the theoretical framework guiding this study and the
   development of hypotheses. Methodology: The current study uses a
   quantitative approach. A between-groups experiment design was employed
   to test how direct and indirect speech acts influence the language
   comprehension of participants. Forty-three IS professionals participated
   in the experiment. In addition, through the use of eye-tracking
   technology, this study captured the attention process and analyzed the
   relationship between attention and comprehension. Results and
   discussion: The results show that the directness of speech acts
   significantly influences participants' attention process, which, in
   turn, significantly affects their comprehension. In addition, the
   findings indicate that indirect speech acts, if employed by IS
   professionals to communicate with others, may easily be distorted or
   misunderstood. Professionals and managers of organizations should be
   aware that effective communication in interdisciplinary projects, such
   as IS development, is not easy, and that reliance on polite or indirect
   communication may inhibit the generation of valid information.},

Abstract = {Research problem: This study explores how established patterns, means,
   and services influence the users' first experience when encountering a
   novel self-service application. The application (DB Cairo) is a
   passenger information system for public transportation running on mobile
   phones. Research questions: Is the users' first experience with the
   application influenced by established communicative patterns, means, and
   services? Are they used as reference objects? Which attributes of the
   application are relevant? Is there a leading reference object
   (prototype)? Do reference objects vary depending on the personal factors
   age and gender? Literature review: Little is known about user experience
   in first contact situations regarding passenger information systems. For
   our investigations, we used a theoretical framework combining Linguistic
   Evaluation Theory, Prototype Theory, and Linguistic Genre Theory:
   Evaluations are regarded as an integral part of user experience.
   Evaluation is conceptualized as an act where a subject evaluates an
   object with a certain purpose at a certain time by comparing it with
   other objects. Every object has various attributes-some are relevant for
   the evaluation, and others are not. Communication quality is seen as a
   crucial complex attribute for the evaluation of communicative
   applications. Methodology: We conducted a qualitative study: Data from
   two user test series (n =12) with thinking-aloud protocols and
   retrospective interviews were analyzed with qualitative content analysis
   procedures. The participants were male and female, age 25-35 or 55-65,
   mobile-phone users, and multimodal travellers. The tests were conducted
   in a laboratory with a computer-based mobile-phone emulator. Results and
   conclusions: Results show that the participants explore the application
   by comparing its attributes with attributes of reference objects.
   Reference objects vary depending on attributes of the application.
   Regarding topic-related attributes, participants rely on established
   artifacts, which form a topic-related multimedia network. Within this
   network, the website of German Railways functions as prototype. Age-and
   gender-specific differences were not detected. The findings indicate
   that research into user experience and development practice could
   benefit from reconstructing and analyzing topic-related artifacts.
   Limitations of the study were a small sample size, the test location,
   and environment. Future challenges are the investigation of influencing
   factors and the development of new methods/ tools for data collection in
   field studies.},

Abstract = {Research problem: This study investigates the characteristics of
   corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are discursive attempts at
   creating positive impact and indicate to readers the process of business
   management in society. Research questions: (1) What is the intended
   purpose and function of the CSR reports taken from some of the most
   dominant corporations in the oil, banking, and aviation industries in
   the US and China, and how and to what extent do these reports meet the
   expectations of the international discourse community? (2) Are there any
   differences in the discursive construction of the CSR reports taken from
   the different industries? If so, what are these differences, and why
   might they exist? Literature review: Contrasting CSR practices in China
   and the US are appropriate because of their economic power, and rigorous
   CSR reporting practices. According to previous research, CSR practices
   in China are mandatory for state-owned enterprises, but voluntary in the
   US. Interdiscursivity, the appropriation of established generic
   resources across genres and practices to create new forms, provides a
   framework for exploring differences in reports between the countries.
   Critical discourse analysis (analyzing discourse as social practice) and
   genre analysis (analyzing discourse as genre), provide methods for
   exploring these differences. Methodology: Using discourse analysis, this
   study analyzed six samples of CSRs, three from Chinese corporations,
   three from American corporations. Samples were selected through rigorous
   online search for top companies in oil, aviation, and banking. The study
   involved a general content analysis of the overall CSR reports using
   genre and critical discourse analysis, and then more focused analysis of
   sections on the environment. Results and discussion: The main function
   of the CSR reports analyzed seems to be the promotion of the company
   image. Although all analyzed reports drew on the discourse of goodwill
   and promoted company engagement with society, CSR reports from the oil
   industry employed discourse of self-justification more, attributing
   company actions to external constraints. CSR, as a generic construct in
   its hybrid form, seems a ``typification{''} of three
   interdiscourses-discourses of promotion, goodwill, and
   self-justification-sociopragmatically co-constructed within an
   interdiscursive space. The purity of this genre lies in its
   hybridization, primarily in the integration of promotional cues in
   reporting genre, illustrating how interdiscursivity can explore the
   interrelationship between discursive and professional practices. The
   limitation of the study was the limited choice of countries and sample
   size. Future research could compare reporting practices of companies
   with newly instituted CSR practices with companies in countries with a
   longer history of CSR reporting.},

Abstract = {While researchers and instructors of technical and professional
   communication have embraced the importance of visual communication
   skills in recent years, little systematic effort has been made to
   develop assessment instruments that measure visual design skills. This
   paper presents a project that examines timed tests as a means of
   measuring a student's ability to solve design problems. The process and
   rationale for the test designs and the results of a series of empirical
   studies are discussed. The results of the studies suggest that timed
   tests can be a viable complement to the project-oriented assessment
   approach suggested by prior studies.},

Abstract = {Distributed work is an increasingly common phenomenon in a number of
   technical and professional settings, and the complexity of this work
   requires high degrees of knowledge sharing and integration that move
   beyond assembly-line approaches to collaboration. Since participants in
   distributed-work settings rely almost exclusively on written and spoken
   language to mediate their collaborative relationships, professional
   communication faculty need educational approaches that empower students
   with language practices designed specifically to support effective
   teaming in these complex environments. To address this need, we employ
   discourse analysis and Speech Act Theory to identify these language
   practices in a case study of two cohorts of distributed,
   interdisciplinary, and cross-cultural student teams. The findings show
   correlations between language practices and successful collaboration.
   These correlations have significant implications for teaching and
   practice.},

Abstract = {This study examines how students enrolled in two Web-based sections of a
   technical writing class performed compared to students enrolled in a
   conventional version of the class. Although no significant difference in
   student performance was found between the two learning conditions, our
   data reveal intriguing relationships between students' prior knowledge,
   attitudes, and learning styles and our Web-based writing environment.
   One finding that we focus on here is that reflective, global learners
   performed significantly better online than active, sequential learners,
   whereas there was no difference between them in the conventional class.
   Our study highlights the complexity of effective Leaching and the
   difficulty of making comparisons between the online and the classroom
   environments. In particular, we maintain that the transfer of active
   learning strategies to the Web is not straightforward and that
   interactivity as a goal of instructional website design requires
   significant elaboration.},

Title = {Living Testimonios: How Latinx Graduate Students Persist and Enact
   Social Justice Within Higher Education},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {197-212},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {About the case: First-generation Latinx students in technical and
   professional communication (TPC) and other graduate programs represent a
   growing percentage of students, yet stories of their experiences within
   higher education remain muted. We analyzed 10 Latinx testimonios
   (culturally situated narratives) wherein they voice their experiences as
   first-generation students in US graduate programs. Testimonialistas
   expressed how they navigate the complexities of being first-generation
   students and described how they persist and enact social justice.
   Situating the case: TPC programs may examine the relationship between
   social injustices and student retention and recruitment efforts, yet
   there is a dearth of literature regarding specific obstacles that Latinx
   students face. We examined how they build success through coalitional
   action and culturally informed tactical decision-making. Methods: We
   recruited participants who self-identified as first-generation Latinx
   students in TPC and other graduate programs. We conducted and recorded
   semistructured interview sessions based in testimonio and intersectional
   feminist methodologies. We used qualitative data coding and MAXQDA
   coding software to assemble and map social justice themes at work across
   the testimonios. Results: Analysis suggests that first-generation Latinx
   graduate students draw on complex informal and formal networks to aid
   their success, desire more effective culturally responsive mentorship,
   and develop tactical decision-making skills to circumvent oppressive
   behaviors. Conclusions: We suggest that directors, mentors,
   administrators, faculty, and Latinx students begin with a social justice
   framework to better listen to, understand, and address first-generation
   Latinx college experiences and build cohort-based support mechanisms
   into programmatic objectives and professional development sessions.},

Title = {The Critical Communication Challenges Between Geographically Distributed
   Agile Development Teams: Empirical Findings},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {322-337},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Although a number of empirical studies have investigated
   communication challenges during recent years, we still need to discover
   the most critical challenges that face communication when agile
   development is geographically distributed. We also need to discover how
   successful geographically distributed agile development (GDAD)
   organizations deal with these challenges. Literature review: Most
   previous studies reported that the critical challenges facing GDAD
   communication can be categorized into five themes: differences in
   cultures, different time zones, different spoken languages, different
   personal skills, and the efficiency and effectiveness of communication
   tools used. Research questions: 1. What are the challenges of
   communication between GDAD teams? 2. How can the impact of GDAD
   communication challenges be mitigated? Methodology: Data were collected
   by interviewing 12 members of a three-team organization using
   distributed agile development. These teams are distributed over three
   countries; the main team located in Australia, the developers' team
   located in China, and the testers' team located in India. A thematic
   analysis technique was used to identify communication challenges and
   practices used to mitigate the effect of these challenges. Results: Our
   findings reveal that the five challenges are still critical to GDAD.
   Moreover, we report a new critical challenge of communication in GDAD,
   the insufficient documentation provided by distributed teams and
   members. In addition, we recommend several practices to mitigate the
   impact of these challenges. Conclusions: Communication among distributed
   agile development teams still faces several critical challenges, and the
   solutions to these challenges provided in recent years have not been
   sufficient. This fact prompts the need for more research on how the
   impact of these challenges can be lessened.},

Abstract = {Background: College and university science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM) students in Japan, who hope for careers in science
   and technology fields, lack the motivation to learn English as a second
   language (L2), impairing their current capacities to learn the L2 and
   their future abilities to communicate globally once employed. Literature
   review: Although these students' motivation to learn English seems
   strongly linked to the external pressure to do well on a standardized
   English test, gain employment, and progress up the career ladder, this
   extrinsic motivation may not be as beneficial for their L2 learning as
   positive images of themselves using English in future situations. Three
   types of future career-related self images-an Ideal L2 Self, a Probable
   L2 Self, and an Ought-to L2 Self-are hypothesized to promote L2
   achievement. Research methodology: Data from questionnaires examining
   psycholinguistic variables for 1013 Japanese STEM students of English
   were subjected to ANOVA and multiple regression analysis with three L2
   Self variables as predictor variables and scores from the TOEIC
   standardized English exam as the outcome variable. Results/discussion:
   ANOVA results showed that students had a strong image of themselves as
   needing English for future career goals, as measured by the Ought-to L2
   Self, but had lower levels of Ideal L2 Self, the variable measuring a
   future image as a fluent user of English. In the regression analysis,
   the Ought-to L2 Self predicted lower TOEIC exam scores; conversely, the
   Ideal L2 Self predicted greater TOEIC scores. These paradoxical results
   indicate that Japanese STEM students struggle motivationally to improve
   English skills needed for future STEM job-related communication, despite
   feeling pressured to do so. Conclusions: To encourage the formation of
   students' images of Ideal L2 selves or stronger Probable L2 selves, STEM
   teachers and language teachers of Japanese STEM students could introduce
   motivational interventions. For example, positive role models of English
   language learners could visit classes and demonstrate how they have
   applied their English as a foreign language (EFL) learning experiences
   to future careers.},

Abstract = {Background: The ability to create a context is essential in writing the
   introduction of a research article (RA). This study explores the
   experience of engineering Ph.D. students in Australia, for whom English
   is an Additional Language (EAL), in using a problem-solution-based
   writing model to develop context-creating skills in writing RA
   introductions. Research question: What is the experience of engineering
   Ph.D. students in creating contexts through explicit learning of a
   problem-solution-based model for writing RA introductions? Literature
   review: Genre-based teaching is a common approach in the second language
   classroom. Recently, a genre-based approach for writing the introduction
   of engineering RAs has been proposed. The descriptive values of the
   model, PSP-CaRS, have been shown in corpus studies of published
   engineering RAs. However, its applicability has not been explored
   pedagogically. Methodology: Twenty-nine Ph.D. students were asked to
   respond to a questionnaire nine months after learning the model and
   reflect on their experience using it. The findings were then
   corroborated with data obtained from interviews, researcher observation,
   and writing samples. Results: The findings showed that the participants
   perceived PSP-CaRS to be useful and they continued using it after nine
   months despite some difficulties encountered in the writing process.
   Participants' responses showed that explicit teaching of PSP-CaRS formed
   the foundation upon which more competent skills to create contexts were
   developed through practice and integration of subject knowledge.
   Discussion: Explicit teaching using a model can impart the basics of
   genre awareness to students. Once students gained an in-depth
   understanding of the model by working through their difficulties, they
   developed better genre awareness, and used the model adaptively to
   visualize and write their RA introductions. Conclusion: The results
   confirm the usefulness of the proposed model and reveal how a continuing
   process of learning and practicing using the model helps students
   develop their skills to create contexts and enhance their genre
   awareness.},

Title = {Collaborating With Writing Centers on Interdisciplinary Peer Tutor
   Training to Improve Writing Support for Engineering Students},

Abstract = {Introduction: Faculty members have little time and usually lack
   expertise to provide writing feedback on lab reports. Sending students
   to a writing center, an existing resource on virtually all college
   campuses, could fill that gap. However, the majority of peer writing
   tutors are in nontechnical majors, and little research exists on
   training them to provide support for engineering students. Research
   question: Can peer writing tutors without technical backgrounds be
   trained to provide effective feedback to engineering students? About the
   case: Previously, sending students to the writing center was
   ineffective. The students did not see the value, and the tutors did not
   feel capable of providing feedback to them. To remedy this situation, an
   interdisciplinary training method was developed collaboratively by an
   engineering professor and the writing center director. Situating the
   case: Researchers have suggested that effective writing center help for
   engineering students is possible, and the authors have designed an
   interdisciplinary training method that has produced positive results.
   Supporting literature includes the use of generalist tutors, writing in
   the disciplines, genre theory, and knowledge transfer. Methods/approach:
   This was a three-year experiential project conducted in a junior-level
   engineering course. The assignment, a lab report, remained the same.
   Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from students and
   tutors. Results/discussion: Tutor feedback and student satisfaction
   significantly improved. However, a few students who were satisfied
   overall still expressed interest in having their reports reviewed by a
   tutor with a technical background. Conclusions: Interdisciplinary tutor
   training can improve the feedback of peer writing tutors, providing
   support for faculty efforts to improve student writing. The method
   requires minimal faculty time and capitalizes on existing resources.},

Title = {Insider Audiences and Plain-Language Revision: A City Charter Case Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {430-447},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: In policy and law contexts, plain-language practice and
   research tend to focus on the benefits of plain language for specific
   nonexpert or public audiences. However, as plain-language use has
   proliferated, documents targeted for revision increasingly include those
   with insider and expert primary audiences. This study investigates the
   effects of plain-language revision on insider audiences following the
   adoption of a revised city charter in a Midwestern US city. Research
   questions: 1. How does plain-language revision affect the way that
   insider city-government users make sense of the city charter? 2. How
   does plain-language revision affect the way that insider city-government
   users act on the city charter? Literature review: Plain language-a
   strategy that writers use to make texts more effective for users-is
   historically and ideologically associated with helping public or
   vulnerable audiences to access complex information. This core priority
   toward public or nonexpert audiences is important; however, it has also
   resulted in a limited understanding of the full scope of plain-language
   audiences, especially in contexts where insider and expert audiences are
   primary users. Methodology: This study, informed by genre theory, is a
   qualitative case study in which textual artifacts and interview data
   were collected and analyzed using a two-cycle qualitative coding
   process. Results: The analysis showed many effects, nearly all positive,
   for insiders and experts. Conclusions: This article focuses on two areas
   of impact: charter authority and user practices. I explore these areas,
   which include improved navigation, organization, and processes, through
   the concept of interplay between the unrevised and revised charters.},

Title = {How Consistent Are the Best-Known Readability Equations in Estimating
   the Readability of Design Standards?},

Volume = {60},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Research problem: Readability equations are widely used to compute how
   well readers will be able to understand written materials. Those
   equations were usually developed for nontechnical materials, namely,
   textbooks for elementary, middle, and high schools. This study examines
   to what extent computerized readability predictions are consistent for
   highly technical material-selected Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
   and International Standards Organization (ISO) Recommended Practices and
   Standards relating to driver interfaces. Literature review: A review of
   original sources of readability equations revealed a lack of specific
   criteria in counting various punctuation and text elements, leading to
   inconsistent readability scores. Few studies on the reliability of
   readability equations have identified this problem, and even fewer have
   systematically investigated the extent of the problem and the reasons
   why it occurs. Research questions: (1) Do the most commonly used
   equations give identical readability scores? (2) How do the scores for
   each readability equation vary with readability tools? (3) If there are
   differences between readability tools, why do they occur? (4) How does
   the score vary with the length of passage examined? Method: Passages of
   varying lengths from 12 selected SAE and ISO Recommended Practices and
   Standards were examined using five readability equations (Flesch-Kincaid
   Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index, Coleman-Liau Index, and
   Automated Readability Index) implemented five ways (four online
   readability tools and Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows). In addition,
   short test passages of text were used to understand how different
   readability tools counted text elements, such as words and sentences.
   Results and conclusions: The mean readability scores of the passages
   from those 12 SAE and ISO Recommended Practices and Standards ranged
   from the 10th grade reading level to about 15th. The mean grade reading
   levels computed across the websites were: Flesch-Kincaid 12.8, Gunning
   Fog 15.1 SMOG 12.6, Coleman-Liau 13.7, and Automated Readability Index
   12.3. Readability score estimates became more consistent as the length
   of the passage examined increased, with no noteworthy improvements
   beyond 900 words. Among the five readability tools, scores typically
   differed by two grade levels, but the scores should have been the same.
   These differences were due to how compound and hyphenated words,
   slashes, numbers, abbreviations and acronyms, and URLs were counted, as
   well other punctuation and text elements. These differences occurred
   because the sources for these equations often did not specify how to
   score various punctuation and text elements. Of the tools examined, the
   authors recommend Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows if the Flesch-Kincaid
   Grade Level is required.},

Title = {The Effect of CMS Technology on Writing Styles and Processes: Two Case
   Studies},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-327},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: When an organization decides to adopt a technology, such as
   a content-management system (CMS), the choice affects writing styles and
   processes, and conversely, writing styles affect the implementation of
   the technology. This case study compares and contrasts the experiences
   of writers in organizations that implemented different types of CMSs: a
   web CMS (WCMS) and a component CMS (CCMS), with a focus on the different
   types of training given to each group to facilitate the implementations.
   Research questions: (1) What are the dependencies between technology
   choices and the corollary editorial constraints that writers must
   consider in order to realize the benefits that the technology can bring?
   (2) What types of training are needed to ensure that writers become
   fully productive in a collaborative, structured-authoring environment?
   Situating the case: When adopting structured information technologies,
   such as CMS, organizations seek to reduce costs and improve efficiencies
   through the reuse and better management of content components, such as
   text and images, which can significantly reduce the costs of
   translation, reproduction, and maintenance of publications. Structured
   information technologies, such as a CMS, Extensible Markup Language
   (XML), and Darwin Information Technology Architecture (DITA) affect
   technical communicators by changing writing styles to a more structured,
   topic-based approach, by introducing new tools and concepts for
   authoring and publishing, and by requiring more involvement in the
   selection, use, and maintenance of the technologies. Previous efforts to
   address these issues through training include works by Critchlow, who
   addressed the use of database systems to address challenges in
   developing documentation in collaborative environments; Edgell, who
   related how technical communicators proposed a CMS-based documentation
   solution to a software firm; and Lanier, who described how one
   organization overcame the resistance to new structured information
   technologies by writers. Methodology: The case was studied as an
   experience report by one of this article's authors (Bailie), in which
   the organizations engaged a consultant during their CMS implementation
   projects. The observations are qualitative and reflect consulting
   engagements with two teams over a period of almost three years. About
   the case: A common problem in implementing CMSs is interdependencies
   between content structures, on which the technology depends, and the
   editorial changes required to ensure that the content is best structured
   to take full advantage of the capabilities of the technology chosen.
   This case describes a four-phase training process provided to two
   clients: one with several contributors to the content-management effort
   in a single location; the other with more than a dozen contributors in
   several locations. Each client received four phase of training: (1)
   theoretical training-understanding pertinent theories behind good
   content development; (2) application of theory-how to apply the theories
   to their workplace; (3) software training-learning the new software to
   produce the content; (4) production-support immediately following
   training, during implementation. The results of the training were to
   increase the skill levels of the writers to understand how to leverage
   content in powerful ways using sophisticated technology. Conclusions:
   Determine the production needed for the content when choosing a class of
   CMS to address those production needs. Afterwards, match the training of
   the writers to the complexity of the system.
   Content strategists, project managers, technical communicators, and
   others involved in implementing a CMS need to allow sufficient time and
   training for writers to adjust their skills to the new technology and
   the new processes and techniques required to effectively use them},

Abstract = {Research problem: Although much research exists on virtual worlds, very
   few studies focus on professional virtual worlds used for working in a
   global setting. Research questions: (1) How do global managers currently
   use and experience professional virtual worlds (Virtual Worlds) as a
   communication media for global work? and (2) How do these Virtual Worlds
   support global and professional communication in a geographically
   distributed context? Literature review: We reviewed Virtual World
   literature in the area of social sciences, education, and games. Little
   research has been conducted on Virtual Worlds for workgroups. But those
   studies support the assumption that Virtual Worlds are suitable for
   global distributed work as a collaboration and communication medium.
   Methodology: With an explorative and qualitative interview research
   approach, we conducted 47 semi-structured interviews with virtual world
   vendors, researchers, and managers using virtual worlds in their work.
   Data were analyzed based on Grounded Theory Analysis methods. Results
   and conclusions: The results show four different use cases applied for
   professional Virtual Worlds: small team meetings, trainings, community
   building, and conferences. Furthermore, our findings confirm Virtual
   World literature that states that the professional Virtual World as a
   communication and collaboration tool supports geographically distributed
   work as well as visualization and learning in a global context.},

Abstract = {This research is based on an analysis of a management communication
   training program used by one large US international hotel company to
   train newly promoted supervisors and managers in Hong Kong and mainland
   China. The key communication competencies emphasized in the training
   materials were listening effectively, giving and receiving feedback,
   using verbal language correctly, using effective nonverbal
   communication, and displaying empathy. Implications of this study
   indicate that planning and executing any communication training program
   must be done mindfully, which includes comprehensive follow-up through
   reassessment and coaching by the upper managers in order to support
   employees' transfer of training.},

   critique by undergraduate, Net-Generation (Net-Gen) students. Fifty-four
   sophomores working in teams of four and five in the College of Business
   at the University of Southern Indiana critiqued the website of Kimball
   International. The report resulted in high-quality criticism of the
   technology, a deep response to the affective qualities of the website,
   and recommendations that were accepted by the corporation. This tutorial
   offers recommendations for this style project's repetition using

Abstract = {Researchers have long studied the effects of social presence and media
   richness on media choice and the effects of media use. This focus on
   social presence and social psychological theories has led to valuable
   research on communication. However little research (either empirical or
   theoretical) has been done to understand the ways in which media choices
   influence the cognitive processes that underlie communication. In this
   paper we present a cognitive-based view of media choice and media use,
   based on dual process theories of cognition, which argue that in order
   for individuals to systematically process messages, they must be
   motivated to process the message and have the ability to process it. We
   argue that the use of rich media high in social presence induces
   increased motivation but decreases the ability to process information,
   while the use of lean media low in social presence induces decreased
   motivation but increases the ability to process information. The paradox
   of richness lies in its duality of impact: from a cognitive perspective,
   rich media high in social presence simultaneously acts to both improve
   and impair performance.},

Abstract = {The impact of differing national and professional cultural backgrounds
   is a salient issue that interacts with technological support of
   distributed teams, As we prepare for the world of the future, it becomes
   imperative that we give students the experience of working in
   multicultural distributed teams. In order to gain experience in this
   area, a project between ten teams of students from the City University
   of Hong Kong and the Eindhoven University of Technology in The
   Netherlands was initiated. A variety of group support technologies,
   primarily GroupSystems, were used to service the teams as they learned
   to work together. This paper documents experiences from the Hong
   Kong-Netherlands project. Eight out of ten student teams successfully
   concluded a seven-week exercise resulting in an integrated report
   related to software engineering. Data collected on the process are
   reported and discussed. Those student teams who succeeded were found to
   be particularly attuned and accommodating to aspects of national and
   professional culture.},

Title = {To Interact and to Narrate: A Categorical Multidimensional Analysis of
   Twitter Use by US Banks and Energy Corporations},

Abstract = {Background: With the development of digital technologies, Twitter allows
   organizations to make better use of social media for impression
   management, advertising, and marketing. Literature review: As a recently
   developed register, Twitter has been researched as a personal-oriented
   communication method, but little research has been conducted on the
   register of corporate Twitter use. This study, exploring Twitter use by
   the 2020 US Fortune 500 banks and energy corporations, may be the first
   one to conduct register analysis of corporate Twitter. Methodology: This
   study used summary language variables of Linguistic Inquiry and Word
   Count (LIWC) as dimensions of register variation, and also conducted
   categorical multidimensional analysis (CMDA) of linguistic features and
   features specific to Twitter. Research questions: 1. What are the
   patterns of register variation in the tweets of US banks and energy
   corporations based on the results of four LIWC summary variables and the
   CMDA method? 2. Are there any differences between tweets of the two
   industries within each pattern of register variation? Results and
   conclusions: Results showed that tweets of both industries tend to
   display a categorical, confident self-regulating style, and a mixed
   tone. Tweets of banks are more formal, self-regulating, and oriented
   toward narrative (congratulatory, positive informational, and
   effortful), while tweets of energy corporations are more authentic and
   oriented toward interaction (advisory, routine, and affiliative). Tweets
   having narrative functions tend to be formal in style and positive in
   tone, while tweets having interactive functions tend to display
   corporations' confidence and leadership. Corporate Twitter is
   characterized by the integration of interaction and informational
   narrative, or ``registerial hybridity.{''} Overall, this study
   strengthens the idea that corporations use Twitter to facilitate
   corporate communication with a broadcasting strategy and narrative
   perspective, and to improve digital communication with an engaging
   strategy. Findings may shed light on promoting products and corporate
   impression management on social media.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Engineering programs must take creative approaches to
   ensure that their students receive needed communication instruction in
   curricula constantly experiencing pressures of accreditation, state, and
   industry requirements: expectations for students' knowledge and skills
   increase although curricula are compressed. Situating the case:
   Technical communication and engineering education scholarship describe
   multiple models for integrating writing instruction into engineering
   curricula: 1. writing across the curriculum, 2. partnership models, 3.
   embedded models, and 4. support models. About the case: Technical and
   professional writing and engineering faculty collaborated to develop a
   hybrid model, which borrows from multiple existing models for
   integrating technical writing education throughout the engineering
   curriculum, both in and outside of courses, including collaborative
   workshops, specialized writing center support, and other interventions.
   Methods/approach: Survey research was conducted with students on the
   effectiveness of multiple writing interventions. Results/discussion: The
   hybrid model enables students to experience a variety of writing
   interventions; students perceived them as beneficial. Students found
   most effective writing interventions occurred in the context of their
   engineering coursework. Faculty and administrators found the approach
   beneficial because of its collaborative nature and because it balanced
   instructional time with external support methods. Conclusions: Local
   solutions to universal problems must take many variables into
   consideration: people and programmatic cultures, disciplinary and
   institutional contexts, and curricular, regulatory, and funding
   constraints. The authors' hybrid model for integrating technical writing
   into the engineering curriculum represents a flexible, sustainable
   approach adaptable to meet specific needs in specific environments at
   different institutions.},

Abstract = {Introduction: To present technical content clearly and effectively for
   global users of English, engineering students need to learn how. About
   the case: Technical communication classes in Spain and the US engaged in
   an international telecollaborative project between cross-cultural
   virtual teams in which students in Spain developed oral presentations
   that were then peer-reviewed by counterparts in the US. Situating the
   case: Research on international professional communication and, more
   specifically, virtual exchange is rapidly growing to explore how
   instructors can help students gain key competencies such as audience
   awareness, intercultural sensitivity, and an understanding of English as
   a lingua franca. Approach/methods: As part of the Trans-Atlantic \&
   Pacific Project network, this project focused on spoken communication.
   Data were analyzed from feedback forms used by US students to evaluate
   oral presentations, and on prelearning and postlearning reports
   completed by students in Spain, as well as from class discussions
   accompanying the project. Results/discussion: Through reflections on
   pragmatic strategies that facilitate exchange and collaboration in
   English as a lingua franca, the engineering students became more fully
   aware of the importance of rhetorical and linguistic factors that affect
   meaning-making for engineers internationally. Conclusion: Results
   suggest that students who participate in transnational virtual exchange
   projects integrate their desire to acquire knowledge with an awareness
   of the importance of sharing knowledge through mindful and inclusive
   communication practices. Technical and engineering communication
   instructors from different countries can heighten their students'
   audience awareness, and cultural and language sensitivities through such
   projects.},

Abstract = {Background: Early-stage accelerator programs teach new entrepreneurs how
   to identify and exploit venture opportunities. In doing so, they
   implicitly teach these new entrepreneurs how to develop and iterate
   claims. But since this function of teaching persuasion has been implicit
   and generally unsystematic, it is unclear how well it works. Literature
   review: We review related literature on the venture development process,
   value propositions, and logic orientation (Goods-Dominant vs.
   Service-Dominant Logic). Research questions: 1. Does an entrepreneurship
   training program implicitly teach new entrepreneurs to make and iterate
   persuasive claims? 2. How effectively does it do so, and how can it
   improve? Research methodology: We examine one such accelerator program
   via a qualitative case study. In this case study, we collected
   interviews, observations, and artifacts, then analyzed them with
   thematic coding. Results/discussion: All teams had received previous
   entrepreneurship training and mentoring. However, they differed in their
   problem and logic orientations as well as their stage in the venture
   development process. These differences related to the extent to which
   they iterated value propositions in the program. Conclusions: We
   conclude with recommendations for improving how accelerator programs can
   better train new entrepreneurs to communicate and persuade.},

Abstract = {Background: In this article, we address the use of metatags as a form of
   community knowledge formation and gatekeeping within digital platforms.
   Situating the case: The subReddit KotakuInAction is a well-known hub of
   the GamerGate community on Reddit, but one that has avoided the bans
   common to other aggressive subReddits and GamerGate communities on
   platforms such as 4chan and GitHub. We contextualize the aggressive
   nature of the subReddit and the reasons why participants uses of
   metatags are meaningful for understanding subReddit culture and
   moderation practices. Methodology: To better understand the destructive
   behavioral patterns of KotakuInAction, we coded for the frequency of
   certain behaviors, such as linking and tagging, as well as the shift in
   certain keywords and vocabularies between the front facing or
   predetermined tags and the user-customized or admin-altered tags. We
   also examined how tags shifted over time and whether certain users
   dominated particular tags. About the case: What we found was a hybrid
   culture on KiA that applied Chan culture values and flaming, but
   increasingly localized the behavior to KiA rather than direct readers
   out of the site. We also found key shifts in topics away from gaming and
   activism toward broader complaints about social justice. In addition, we
   found that a tiny core group of nine influencers (out of tens of
   thousands of users) accounted for 20 of the top conversations.
   Conclusions: We suggest a closer examination of how communities
   self-organize around meta naming structures. Knowledge of this activity
   can help with predicting and engaging with aggressive and hostile
   communities by describing how topics shift over time, how they adapt to
   platform moderation, and who the influencers within a community might
   be.},

Abstract = {Background: Research suggests that communication instruction is
   particularly effective when situated in disciplinary courses. While
   studies show that this approach improves communication skills, less is
   known about how it enhances engineering learning. Literature review:
   Prior work includes approaches to integrating communication into
   engineering, studies of writing to learn, and explorations of the role
   of communication in identity development. Research question: How might
   the integration of communication instruction and practice into
   undergraduate engineering courses support engineering learning?
   Methodology: Because little is known about how communication instruction
   enhances engineering learning, we conducted an exploratory case study of
   an established integrated program in one European university.
   Participants included six engineering instructors, five engineering
   program heads, and six engineering students. Using interviews and focus
   groups, we explored the engineering-specific gains that faculty and
   students perceived from integrating communication assignments into
   engineering courses. Results: Our analysis yielded three salient areas
   of learning: 1. understanding disciplinary content, 2. selecting
   important information, and 3. justifying choices. While the first aligns
   tightly with writing-to-learn research, all three themes, in fact,
   bridge content learning and disciplinary literacy to enhance students'
   development as engineering professionals. Conclusions: Communication
   instruction can potentially support engineering learning through
   assignments that prompt students to select information in ways that are
   consistent with both disciplinary values and the needs of stakeholders,
   and make and justify decisions about approaches and solutions in ways
   that demonstrate sound engineering judgment.},

Abstract = {Correspondence analysis is a statistical method that allows researchers
   to explore relationships among complex categorical variables. This paper
   will provide researchers with the theoretical and practical foundations
   for understanding and applying correspondence analysis to their own
   research agendas. Problem: Technical communicators use a variety of
   research methods and collect a variety of types of data. Of particular
   interest to technical communicators is categorical data, or data that
   are not traditionally quantitative. For instance, technical
   communicators often collect and analyze language data from a variety of
   texts. Analyzing this type of data can be difficult using traditional
   statistical methods. Key concepts: Variable types, a priori versus
   exploratory research designs, contingency tables, and data visualization
   are central to understanding the foundations of correspondence analysis.
   Key lessons: To conduct correspondence analysis, a researcher must walk
   through a series of steps including: (1) determining whether
   correspondence analysis is appropriate, (2) choosing a statistical
   software package, (3) running the correspondence analysis, and (4)
   interpreting and applying the results. Implications for practice: While
   correspondence analysis provides many useful insights into categorical
   data, a researcher must consider several things when deciding to use
   correspondence analysis. These include the potential to misinterpret and
   misapply the results of a correspondence analysis.},

Title = {Reasons for Using English or the Local Language in the Genre of Job
   Advertisements: Insights From Interviews With Dutch Job Ad Designers},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research problem: This study provides insight into practitioners'
   reasons for choosing a particular language (English versus the local
   language) in the genre of job ads in countries where English is a
   foreign language (EFL countries). Scholarly publications and public
   discourse have suggested reasons for language choice, but these were not
   based on the perspectives of practitioners. Research questions: (1) What
   reasons do Dutch job ad writers give for using all-English, all-Dutch,
   or partly English ads and what genre factors inform these reasons? (2)
   To what extent do the reasons given by Dutch job ad makers for using
   all-English, all-Dutch, or partly English ads complement reasons
   mentioned in publications on job ads? Literature review: Genre theory
   identifies three factors as important determinants of genre: contextual
   factors (such as characteristics of the organization and the sector in
   which the genre is produced), reader-writer factors (characteristics of
   the genre's target audience and author), and textual factors (the
   genre's content, structure, and wording). The reasons mentioned for the
   use of all-English job ads are that English is the organization's
   corporate language and that the organization is looking for
   English-speaking candidates. The reasons given for the use of job ads in
   the local language are that English is less clear than the local
   language and that English words are strange and exaggerated compared to
   equivalents in the local language. Among the reasons mentioned for the
   use of partly English job ads are that English words attract more
   attention than equivalents in the local language and that English job
   titles sound more modern and have more status than equivalent job titles
   in the local language. Methodology: In this qualitative study, we
   conducted 25 interviews with practitioners who designed job ads in the
   Netherlands, selected because they had recently placed an all-English,
   an all-Dutch, or a partly English job ad in a Dutch newspaper. They were
   asked an open-ended question about their reasons behind the language
   used in the job ad they placed. Interview data were labelled and
   categorized; subsequently, patterns were identified across categories.
   Results and conclusions: The interviews showed that all three types of
   genre factors-contextual, reader-writer, and textual-underlie
   practitioners' language choices. Practitioners mentioned the same types
   of factors that were mentioned in publications on job ads, but gave a
   greater variety of reasons for language choice. Of the reasons mentioned
   by the practitioners, the large majority were not given in publications.
   These findings underline the importance of obtaining text producers'
   perspectives and can be used to sensitize both novice and experienced
   professional Human Resources writers to the relevance of genre factors
   in language choice. A limitation of the present study is that the
   desired effects of language choice mentioned by the respondents were not
   verified with the target group of the job ads. Therefore, future
   research on language choice in workplace writing should test whether
   particular language choices in job ads actually achieve the recruitment
   effects Human Resource Manager professionals expect.},

Title = {A Path to Successful Management of Employee Security Compliance: An

Abstract = {Research problem: Although organizations have been exerting a
   significant effort to leverage policies and procedures to improve
   information security, their impact and effectiveness is under scrutiny
   as employees' compliance with information security procedures remains
   problematic. Research questions: (1) What is the role of information
   security climate (ISC) in cultivating individual's compliance with
   security policy? (2) Do individual affective and normative states
   mediate the effect of ISC to increase security policy compliance
   intention while thwarting employees' security avoidance? Literature
   review: Drawing upon Griffin and Neal's safety climate model, which
   states the effect of safety climate on individual safety behaviors that
   lead to specific performance outcomes, we develop an ISC model to
   empirically examine the efficacy of security climate in governing
   employee's policy compliance. The literature suggests that there could
   be practical reasons for employees not to observe the security policies
   and procedures. These go beyond the simple lack of use or negligence,
   and include rationalizing security violation, particularly in light of
   the fact that they are under pressure to get something done without
   delays in daily work. To empirically address such employee behavior, we
   employed the term, security avoidance in this study-an employee's
   deliberate intention to avoid security policies or procedures in daily
   work despite the need and opportunity to do so. Methodology: We surveyed
   IT users in South Korea about individuals' perception about various
   organizational/managerial information security practices in the work
   environment. Results and discussion: The results from 581 participants
   strongly support the fundamental proposition that the information
   security climate has a significant positive impact on employee's
   conformity with the security policy. The study also reveals that the
   security climate nurtures the employee's affective and cognitive states
   through affective commitment and normative commitment. These, in turn,
   mediate the influence of security climate on employee policy compliance
   by facilitating rule adherence among employees while, at the same time,
   inspiring self-adjusted behaviors to neutralize their deliberate intents
   of negligence. Overall, the findings support our view that the creation
   of strong security climate is the adequate alternative to a
   sanction-based deterrence to employees' security policy compliance,
   which limits the presence of security avoidance. The implications to
   theory are the multidimensional nature of ISC construct and its linkage
   to a systematic view of individual level information security
   activities. The implications to practice are the ISC's favorable role of
   discouraging employee's security avoidance while inducing the security
   policy compliance intention at the same time, given the limit of
   sanctions.},

Abstract = {Research problem: No study has observed the argumentative choices and
   appeals used by professional designers to support their claims as they
   engage in decision-making sessions. In particular, we do not know how
   user-derived data are applied by professional designers in their
   decision-making arguments. Research questions: (1) What kinds of
   evidence and appeals do advocates of user-centered design use when
   supporting claims within design decision-making sessions? (2) How do
   evidence and appeals used by professional designers compare to evidence
   and appeals used by previously studied novice designers? Literature
   review: Previous research of user-centered design that also incorporates
   data-driven personas has concluded that while some observed groups
   dedicated to user-centered design see personas as a way to further
   improve upon user-centered design methods, personas rarely become an
   integrated part of the design process and are often not incorporated in
   recommended ways. Prior research of decision-making within the design
   process has concluded that decision-making is a highly variable, but
   often deeply collaborative activity that can be assessed through a
   variety of argumentative lenses, including the Toulmin model of
   argument. Methodology: In this case study, a one-week, onsite
   exploratory observation was conducted in the workplace of professional
   designers. All meetings were recorded and subsequently transcribed.
   Postobservation interviews were also conducted with the participants. A
   discourse-based analysis was conducted on the transcriptions to identify
   the various types of rhetorical appeals and evidence used by the
   designers during their decision-making meetings. Results and
   conclusions: This onsite observation found that this particular group of
   designers supported about 50\% of their claims with evidence, with 5.1\%
   of the evidence in support of a claim referencing user data, and 33.4\%
   of evidence in support of a claim referencing the designer's own
   opinion. These results suggest, among other things, that personas (the
   key user-centered design tool used by the observed group) are perhaps
   not necessarily a helpful rhetorical tool for persuasion in
   decision-making meetings, that designers who conduct user research are
   more likely to reference user data in support of claims, that these
   designers might have a broad notion of what constitutes user data, and
   that prior experience can serve as a powerful persuasive force. In
   addition, appeals to user data were the least common type of appeal
   employed by the novice and professional designers. However, this
   exploratory study is limited by the condensed observation time and its
   single group of designers. Future studies may use the methodology
   established here to explore the uses of evidence of additional groups.},

Abstract = {Research Problem: This study investigates the impact of deception on the
   performance of tasks in virtual teams. While the advantages of virtual
   teams in organizations have been well-studied, as the use of these teams
   expands, organizations must acknowledge the potential for negative
   consequences of team member actions. Research Questions: (1) How does
   deceptive communication influence the outcomes of virtual group
   collaboration? and (2) How does perceived deception impact the
   individual perceptions, such as perceived trustworthiness and mutuality,
   of the virtual team itself? Literature Review: Based on (1), the
   conclusion from the literature on virtual teams that trust and mutuality
   are vital toward team development, (2) the propositions put forth by
   Interpersonal Deception Theory that deception will be perceived by team
   members, and (3) from the conclusion from the literature on
   interpersonal deception and trust that deception will impact outcomes of
   an interaction, including trust, mutuality, and ultimately team
   performance, we developed a model of the impact of deception on outcomes
   in virtual teams. This model suggests that deceptive communication
   negatively impacts task performance. Deceptive communication is also
   expected to impact perceived deception both within and between groups.
   The model further proposes that perceived deception will negatively
   impact both perceived trustworthiness and mutuality. Methodology:
   Through an experiment, virtual teams of three members participated in a
   group decision-making task in which team members must cooperate to
   search a grid for enemy camps and then collaborate on a strike plan,
   with half the teams populated by a deceptive team member. Two-hundred
   seventeen subjects were recruited from courses at three universities.
   Five experimental sessions were conducted across two semesters in
   computer labs at the three universities. Following the virtual team
   experiment, subjects completed surveys related to key constructs.
   Analysis of variance and linear regression were used to test the
   hypotheses. Results and Discussion: Deception has a negative impact on
   task performance by virtual teams. Participants perceived deception when
   it was present. Perceived deception led to decreased mutuality and trust
   among team members. These findings suggest that organizations that
   utilize virtual teams must be aware of and prepared to deal with
   negative behaviors, such as deception. The generalizability of these
   findings is potentially limited by the use of student subjects in a
   laboratory setting. Future research may extend these findings by
   incorporating additional variables that have been found to be important
   to virtual team outcomes or studying the current model in a longitudinal
   design.},

Abstract = {Communication metaphors have been applied extensively to understand the
   managerial performance and organizational behavior of a singlefirm.
   However fewer attempts have been made to apply communication metaphors
   to understand the dynamics of interfirm relations, or offshore
   partnerships. While all outsourcing contracts pose well-understood
   challenges, offshoring partnerships are often further complicated by
   culture and maturity/capability differences.
   Our analysis employs the results of a case study to delineate the
   different conversational metaphors that emerged from four discrete
   phases of offshore information systems development. Offshore success is
   contingent upon successful technical communication which is mediated
   through communication metaphors-in-use between vendor and client. In
   instances where management cannot directly dictate emergent
   conversational styles, it can determine organizational structure,
   coordination processes, contract and device incentives, and task
   allocation in order to cultivate a communication metaphor-in-use most
   appropriate to the specific phase of the offshore partnership, thereby
   mitigating many of the complications posed by culture and maturity
   differences.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to a discussion on collaboration and
   technical/professional communication in indeterminate zones or less
   familiar sites for collaboration. The interdisciplinary group for this
   case. study collaborated to write a project proposal to solicit funds
   from the US government for constructing a test bed for immune buildings
   as. a tactic for combating potential biological and chemical terrorist
   incidents. Their approach to collaboration coincided with several
   approaches previously addressed in professional and technical
   communication research. Novel and creative approaches emerged as a
   result of this collaboration, but in some instances, disciplinary
   differences, as manifested by disputes over concepts and terminologies,
   posed obstacles to collaboration. Such challenges necessitated strong
   leadership, which was also critical for managing group process.},

Abstract = {Ideally, illustrations for procedural documents should show actions from
   the point of view of performers, especially if performers' bodies need
   to be positioned a particular way to perform actions. At the same time,
   illustrations also should ameliorate the limits of two-dimensional
   displays (such as the printed page or electronic screen) by showing
   bodies, objects, and movements across the display plane. These two
   requirements may conflict, possibly necessitating use of compromise
   views.},

Title = {What Eye Tracking Can Show Us About How People Are Influenced by
   Deceptive Tactics in Line Graphs},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 4},
Abstract = {Background: Graphs, especially those that are generated automatically,
   are often subject to mistakes in their processing, framing, and
   construction, sending unintended messages that neither the viewer nor
   the author may realize. This article analyzes the eye-tracking data of
   57 participants to extend the results of a previous study that
   investigated how people are deceived by common mistakes and deceptive
   tactics in data visualizations and titles. Literature review: Previous
   research has suggested that viewers are susceptible to deception by
   misleading titles or graph presentations, and that such information can
   influence how they interpret graphs. Previous eye-tracking research has
   only measured viewing patterns of nondeceptive graphs. Research
   questions: 1. How much attention do participants give to various areas
   of a graph when not given any instruction on what to look for, nor what
   they might be asked about? 2. Are there differences in how participants
   view and interpret deceptive versus control graphs about
   noncontroversial topics? 3. Are there differences in how participants
   view and interpret graphs about noncontroversial topics paired with
   control or exaggerated titles? Methodology: This study analyzed view
   time, fixations, revisits, and time to first fixation for the graph
   area, title, y-axis, and x-axis of four line graphs. Qualitative
   responses were also coded and analyzed. Results: Among other significant
   findings, this study found that participants spent significantly less
   time looking at both line graph axes for graphs with a rhetorically
   exaggerated title than those with a control title. Participants also
   fixated on and revisited deceptive graphs more so than control graphs,
   and fixated and revisited the title and x-axis of control graphs
   significantly more than deceptive graphs. Qualitative results contribute
   further patterns. Discussion: Findings suggest that graphs with
   exaggerated titles make viewers less attentive to the axes, but
   deceptive graphs cause viewers to examine the lines of the graphs
   themselves in greater detail. Conclusion: Subtle changes in the makeup
   of graphics can significantly change how viewers examine such

Title = {Using Eye Tracking to Study Information Selection and Use in Procedures},

Abstract = {Background: Procedures are an important part of instructional materials.
   To support practitioners in designing effective procedures, research is
   needed on how users select information from a procedure and put it to
   use. This study demonstrates how eye tracking can be used to inform such
   research. Eye tracking is used to study effects of adding pictures to
   procedures in a software tutorial on how users interact with procedures.
   Literature review: Existing methods have led to important insights but
   face limitations. Eye tracking has the potential to overcome some of
   these limitations. However, research designs are needed that leave it to
   the user when to read and when to act. Research questions: 1. Does
   adding pictures to procedures improve user performance and, if so, why?
   What can we learn from eye tracking about the mechanisms that bring
   about performance improvements? 2. How do users interact with procedures
   that they read ``to do ``? What can we learn from eye tracking about
   reading strategies that they spontaneously adopt? Methodology: Eye
   movements were recorded from 42 participants as they worked through one
   of two versions of a tutorial: with or without pictures. Results:
   Accuracy on tasks was higher when the procedures included pictures.
   Including pictures sped up processing the instructions and executing the
   actions, but did not trigger more attention switches between the
   procedures and the application that the users worked with. Users
   spontaneously adopted a strategy of immediate task execution and
   processed pictures before acting. Conclusions: Pictures facilitate
   efficient processing of procedures, leaving more resources for task
   execution. Reading and acting are tightly connected in a complex
   pattern. Eye tracking will be of value to examine their interplay
   further and the ways that it can be influenced by design.},

Abstract = {Background: This case study presents graduate recruiting strategies
   developed and piloted in Fall 2018 and 2019. We initiated relationships
   with majority-minority universities, aiming to recruit underrepresented
   students to Utah State University's technical communication graduate
   programs. Research question: How may technical communication graduate
   programs at predominantly White institutions craft customized recruiting
   strategies to center multiply marginalized or underrepresented (MMU)
   applicants? Situating the case: Scholars have long advocated recruiting
   strategies that develop new ways of working with institutions that
   enroll large numbers of minoritized students to attract those students.
   Recruiting strategies that build and strengthen these relationships can
   decenter the academy and focus on the lived experiences of potential
   applicants. How this case was studied: Serving as the framework of our
   research methodology, the four tenets of alternative epistemology based
   on Black Feminist Theory directly informed specific recruiting
   strategies that we piloted in Fall 2018, then revised and piloted again
   in Fall 2019. About the case: Given the homogeneity of our field, it was
   important to develop recruiting strategies focused on marginalized
   groups. With this in mind, we established an annual graduate program
   recruiting trip to visit Historically Black Colleges and Universities
   (HBCUs) and majority-minority universities. Conclusions: In piloting
   recruiting strategies that center the perspectives and experiences of
   marginalized people, we identified two major priorities that should
   inform recruiting efforts: building relationships and enhancing
   inclusivity.},

Abstract = {Background: Many countries mandate transparency and consent when
   personal data are handled by online services. However, most users do not
   read privacy policies or cannot understand them. An important challenge
   for technical communicators is empowering users to manage their online
   privacy responsibly. Literature review: Research suggests that privacy
   visualizations may alleviate this problem, but existing approaches are
   incomplete and under-researched. Research questions: 1. How can we
   design a privacy rating that optimally empowers users with different
   levels of knowledge about and awareness of online privacy? 2. How do
   users react to such a privacy rating, in terms of usability, perceived
   usefulness, and trust in online services? Methodology: We developed
   Privacy Rating, a tool for mapping and visualizing the privacy of online
   services. The tool was subjected to user research (N = 30) focusing on
   usability, perceived usefulness, and effects on trust. To establish the
   effects on trust, participants were exposed to a website with either a
   positive or a negative privacy rating. Results: The Privacy Rating
   appeared to be usable and useful for lay users, and it had a significant
   effect on users' trust in the online service. Users indicated that they
   would like the visualization to become an established standard,
   preferably approved by an independent organization. Conclusions: The
   Privacy Rating is a user-friendly privacy visualization covering all
   relevant aspects of privacy. We aim to bring the tool to the market and
   make it a standard, ideally supported by an independent trustworthy
   organization.},

Abstract = {Background: The cognitive load involved in research article (RA) reading
   can be overwhelming for L2 novice readers. RA section headings can be
   used as signals to help novices focus on essential information related
   to their learning goals to reduce extraneous cognitive processing. There
   is a need to examine RA macrostructures to inform RA reading
   instruction. Literature review: RAs do not always follow the
   Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion (IMRD) model. Previous research
   has examined the macrostructure of articles in disciplines such as
   computer science, applied linguistics, and pure mathematics, but few
   have investigated the macrostructure of economics RAs. Research
   questions: 1. Are there any sections frequently used in economics
   articles apart from the conventional sections? 2. If yes, what are the
   views of expert economics RA readers on the communicative functions and
   propositional content of the newly identified sections of economics RAs?
   Research methods: Eighty RAs were collected from five economics journals
   using stratified random sampling. Following Yang and Allison's
   macrostructure analysis method, we conducted an analysis of the overall
   structure of the RAs based on section headings and the function and
   content of each section. Results: Compared with the IMRD model, we found
   six new section types: Background, Theoretical Model, Econometric Model,
   Robustness, Mechanisms, and Application. Interviews were conducted to
   explore expert RA readers' genre knowledge on the newly identified
   sections. Conclusion: The findings can be useful for RA reading and
   writing instruction and future research on part-genres of economics
   articles.},

Abstract = {Background: The participatory web complicates professional communicators
   goals of providing accurate, usable, and trustworthy content, especially
   for health and medical topics. Professionals can better reach their
   audiences by understanding individuals purposes for using e-health.
   Literature review: Previous literature has shown the need for audience
   analysis in e-health, and has called for personalized, nuanced, and
   contextualized methods for developing audience-centered content.
   Professional communicators in e-health can use personas as a strategy to
   help account for users diverse, evolving, and extra-institutional
   purposes in accessing e-health, whether that content is
   professionally-generated or user-generated. Research questions: 1. What
   are patients larger information-seeking contexts 2. For what purposes do
   patients use e-health 3. How can professional communicators leverage
   this deepened understanding of their audiences purposes to improve their
   content Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with seven community
   members who self-identified as e-health users. They were asked about
   their larger health information-seeking practices, specific instances of
   using e-health, and website preferences. Results: Participants use
   e-health among other sources including medical professionals. They use
   an array of e-health sites, including professional and user-generated
   sites, and have diverse purposes in using that array of sites.},

Title = {Caveat Emptor: How Lay Technical and Professional Communicators Sell
   Technical Products in C2C E-Commerce},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {Background: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce involves consumers
   re-selling products to other consumers using online platforms. Research
   identifies trust as a major factor in this exchange. It concludes that
   seller-generated product descriptions can mitigate mistrust. Further,
   technical and professional communication research can reveal what
   content sellers tend to provide and can reveal how platform design may
   encourage that content. Literature review: C2C e-commerce and TPC
   researchers agree that mistrust can be mitigated by detailed content,
   and they call for platform designers to help improve platform and seller
   reputations. Research questions: 1. What content do sellers provide
   about their technical products 2. How do the platforms web form designs
   and the associated documentation about listing a product for sale
   encourage certain content types Research methodology: Four platforms
   were chosen using specific criteria. Product descriptions were collected
   once per week for six weeks, generating 1900 product descriptions. These
   descriptions were unitized and given reliable content categories, a
   methodology called quantitative content analysis. Further, the
   documentation and processes for posting items were explored to determine
   how they may encourage content types. Results/discussion: Sellers mostly
   provide product information and sales procedures, and they rarely give
   benefits and goodwill to the buyer. The platform design seems to
   encourage this content because of the content-entry process, the
   content-entry options, and the required and unrequired content entry.
   Conclusions: This study invites technical and professional communicators
   to provide more guidelines for users about the kinds of content they may
   include, and designers to explore the content entry process using
   usability and user-experience research.},

Title = {Is Enterprise Gamification Being Cannibalized by Its Own Brand?},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Research problem: Gamification is a concept that originates from the
   digital media domain. It includes a process of enhancing a service using
   game design elements in nongame contexts. Although much research exists
   on gamification, very few studies focus on the application of
   gamification in the enterprise. Research questions: (1) How do managers
   currently use and experience gamification as a communication medium? (2)
   Why is it that few instances of gamification exist in enterprise
   management? (3) Is gamification's own branding somehow cannibalizing
   itself in enterprise applications? Literature review: We reviewed
   gamification literature in the workplace and looked at the applicability
   of game design elements within the enterprise culture. Enterprise
   gamification is still considered uncharted territory, and more research
   on gamification in the enterprise is needed. But existing research
   studies support our claims that there is high potential for enterprise
   gamification that needs to be explored. Methodology: Observations were
   made during fieldwork with an exploratory interview research approach.
   These observations were put to test via an online psychological
   single-blind controlled quantitative experiment conducted with 198
   survey respondents to investigate the effect of branding on gamification
   and its perception in the enterprise context. Results and conclusions:
   The results show that using the ``gamification{''} brand clearly drives
   lower rates of perceived acceptance of the concept, whereas using an
   ``unbranded{''} version of the same gamification concepts results in
   comparatively higher rates of perceived acceptance and a general
   willingness to adopt within the enterprise context. The results also
   confirm that ``interest{''} and ``branding{''} are interrelated, and
   that gamification faces higher rates of resistance, lower rates of
   adoption, and lower success rates in the enterprise compared to other
   fields. Thus, enterprise gamification may not be correctly branded, and
   our research recommends the use of a set of procedural, prepackaged best
   practices, in the form of an implementation framework, to guarantee
   optimal design and implementation.},

Title = {Efficiently Connecting Textual and Visual Information in Operating
   Instructions},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {346-366},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research problem: Most technical documents rely on a combination of text
   and visuals to communicate their messages. To achieve the desired effect
   of improved processing and comprehension of operating instructions, the
   text must guide readers in a clear way to the relevant visual
   information in order to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretation, and to
   ensure that the reader optimally benefits from the available
   information.
   Research questions: (1) How are textual and visual information combined
   in operating instructions in order to guide the user's attention
   precisely toward the relevant parts of a household appliance? (2) In
   what ways can ambiguity arise, and what kinds of strategies can be used
   to avoid miscommunication and conceptual problems? Literature review:
   Operating manuals are usually procedural instructions that tell the user
   how to set up an appliance, how to operate and maintain it, and how to
   solve any problems. The vast majority of operating instructions are
   multimodal in that they include visuals of some kind. But previous
   research has shown that visual representations of instructions can be
   just as difficult to interpret as textual instructions-especially if the
   visuals come without textual elaboration. A combination of text and
   visuals provides opportunities for taking advantage of both by balancing
   the other mode's limitations. Methodology: Our exploratory qualitative
   study of a small set of operating instructions identifies and classifies
   types of references to visuals in the documents, enriched by interviews
   with the technical writers of these manuals. Besides showing patterns of
   reference types, we examine the potential ambiguity of some types of
   references along with strategies to avoid communication failure. Results
   and conclusions: We identified 10 distinct ways in which links from text
   to visuals can be established. Line drawings were referred to more than
   visuals showing display content. The clarity of the link between text
   and visuals may be affected by the use of spatial expressions (such as
   left/right) that presuppose an underlying perspective, as well as by the
   use of semantic and functional information that is not readily
   accessible to laypersons. Ambiguity can be avoided by using clearly
   defined labels, specific perceptual information, and by repetition of
   visual elements in the text. Also, overspecification can be useful for
   enhancing communication. We conclude that technical writers need to
   attend to the links between text and visuals in order to support users
   effectively, avoiding ambiguity by purposeful strategies. Because our
   study is qualitative and analytic, implications are limited by the scope
   of our study, and by the lack},

Title = {Critical Factors Influencing Diffusion of Interactivity Innovations on

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-19},

Abstract = {Research problem: Most of the previous research into corporate websites
   has focused on the users' point of view and their perception of
   usability and interactivity as the two predominant website
   characteristics, and has shown that interactivity plays an important
   role in consumers' perceptions of, and responses to, these sites. This
   study explores corporate websites from a different view-that of the
   company-and investigates the organizational motivation to adopt new
   interactive features on corporate websites. Research question: What are
   the critical factors influencing the firm's adoption of online
   innovations related to interactivity on their websites? Literature
   review: Many dominant theories in information technology (IT) that guide
   most research on IT adoption at the firm level include the diffusion of
   innovations theory (which seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate
   new ideas and technology spread through cultures) and the technology,
   organization, and environment framework (which identifies three aspects
   of an enterprise's context that influence the process by which it adopts
   and implements a technological innovation). But other research streams
   can contribute to the Theory of Technology Adoption at the firm level,
   including Institutional Theory (which is a widely accepted theoretical
   posture that emphasizes rational myths, isomorphism, and legitimacy) and
   the model of Iacovou (which analyzes interorganizational systems'
   characteristics that influence firms to adopt IT innovations).
   Methodology: A conceptual model with supporting propositions was tested
   using an online questionnaire. Data were collected from 138 firms in
   Switzerland and Germany and analyzed with multiple regression analysis.
   Results and conclusions: Complexity, perceived benefits, top management
   support, and information intensity are the drivers that play important
   roles in the diffusion of innovation related to interactivity on

Abstract = {Background: This case recounts my experiences during a four-year
   participatory design project with colleagues in Katanga Province of the
   Democratic Republic of Congo, where I attempted to develop a system for
   people working in rural areas to share business information via mobile
   phones. Research questions: For the first phase of this project: How do
   businesspeople in Katanga Province use their cell phones to support
   their business operations? How do they want to use these phones in their
   businesses? How do their use and attitudes compare with those of
   graduate students at a Midwestern US university? For the second phase of
   this project: Can a cell-phone delivered information system be designed
   for artisanal miners and small farmers in Katanga Province to share
   local pricing information for copper, cobalt, and maize? Situating the
   case: Researchers in participatory design for social and/or
   technological change have traditionally assumed that including users in
   early design phases will result in democratization of project outcomes.
   When these participatory design projects are situated in intercultural
   settings, however, they are complicated by political and economic
   conditions, as well as differences in values and social relations.
   Because participatory design relies on dialogue within robust,
   multimodal communication networks, weaknesses in this approach arise
   when trusted social relations are not in place upon which to build these
   multimodal communication networks. Cases of participatory design between
   colleagues in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa illustrate profound effects
   of political and economic inequities on participatory design projects.
   Methodology: This is an experience report of a project that developed
   initially from a classroom project in which my students in the US
   conducted a communication audit for a partner based in Katanga Province
   in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A US-based nongovernmental
   organization (NGO) arranged the partnership and I later went to the
   field to carry out this project. About the case: Working with an NGO
   while based exclusively in the US, we attempted to develop a system from
   which people working in rural areas could share business information,
   such as reporting business conditions in a rural location back to the
   NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters 75 km away, via mobile phones. The project
   did not work because people in Katanga were not familiar with the
   information design issues involved in the system and I was not familiar
   with the actual business situation at the NGO in Katanga. To address
   these issues, I traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo and
   interviewed NGO staff and clients. But my presence in the NGO's
   Lubumbashi headquarters created irreparable social disruption. I
   continued the project with a new client in Katanga and revised goals for
   the information-sharing system, but that system, too, did not work for
   lack of a trusted social network of informants to participate in the
   information-sharing system. In the end, I was only able to complete an
   initial analysis of the needs.
   Conclusions: Despite the need to abandon the project, this case raised
   these questions about participatory design for information and
   communication technologies (ICT) projects when collaborators do not
   ``speak the same language:{''} How can communication researchers
   effectively build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing
   nations in order to facilitate successful participatory design projects?
   Given the research obligations and reward structures at US universities,
   is it feasible for communication researchers to spend the time to build
   trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations, which may
   not yield publishable research or quantifiable results for three years
   or more? Given the political and social conditions in many developing
   areas, can communication researchers rely on the stable conditions and
   personal relations that are necessary to conduct participatory design
   for ICT projects?},

Abstract = {Teaching problem: Students' written assignments show that they tend to
   list ideas rather than provide evidence-based arguments. This might be
   because they do not have a framework to base their arguments on.
   Research question: Does the communication model framework help students
   to write evidence-based arguments when evaluating the communicative
   effectiveness in corporate blogs? Situating the case: The ability to
   engage in argument from evidence is one of the Next Generation Science
   Standards for scientific and engineering practices. Thus, it is
   important for engineering students to know how to present evidence-based
   arguments. The communication model framework was introduced to provide
   students with a framework to base their arguments on. This framework
   builds on the genre-based and academic literacies approaches to teaching
   writing. More companies are now using corporate blogs (an open,
   participatory, and globally networked social media tool) to engage
   stakeholders directly across multiple contexts. The framework is useful
   in analyzing evolving genres like corporate blogs because it is not only
   structured but also flexible. About the case: This teaching case
   describes the use of the communication model framework as the basis for
   students' arguments. The framework was used in a general writing course
   for engineering students. Working in groups, the students used the
   framework for their oral practice critique and their critique assignment
   on a given piece of academic writing or corporate blog. They also had to
   write a reflection paper individually at the end of the course. Results:
   Overall, the mixed groups and international students groups made a
   stronger attempt to apply the framework compared to the Singaporean
   student groups. The students' educational backgrounds, the group
   dynamics within the group, and the nature of the discussions affected
   the level of adoption of the framework in their writing. Conclusions:
   This teaching case reflects the value of mixed group, face-to-face
   discussions, and personal reflection in teaching students evidence-based
   writing, and calls for more research on flexible frameworks as genres
   evolve.},

Abstract = {Global virtual teams (GVTs) can provide benefits in terms of lower costs
   and enhanced performance. However, the realization of these benefits
   depends on effective GVT task coordination, which faces significant
   challenges due to time-zone differences and geographical dispersion.
   Further, there is a lack of understanding of optimal
   information-technology (IT)-mediated coordination mechanisms for these
   teams. Based on an in-depth study of project tasks carried out by three
   GVTs, we uncovered IT-mediated task coordination portfolios (sets of
   mechanisms) used for effective coordination. The portfolios should fit
   the GVT's task dependence, members' common time frame, and perceived
   time constraints in order to be effective.},

Abstract = {Legislative requirements like those in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have
   sharply increased the incidence of monitoring of electronic
   communications, but the consequences of this trend are little
   understood. This study examines the impact of organizational monitoring
   of sensitive instant message (IM) discussions with a designed
   experiment. When their IMs are known to be monitored, individuals are
   found to sharply curtail their discussion of personally incriminating
   information and to increase their spontaneous denials of knowledge of
   sensitive topics. Surprisingly, perhaps. they also increase their
   discussion of relayed information that may incriminate others or the
   organization. Qualitative analysis suggests that people are not aware
   they make these adjustments to their IM communication content when
   monitored. Given the legislative compliance motivations for some of the
   monitoring activity in companies. it is ironic that study findings
   suggest organizations may communicate less firsthand information about
   potentially curtailable legal liabilities and other sensitive incidents
   requiring corrective action when communication is monitored.
   Organizations enacting monitoring of IM should pay heed to the
   requirements as well as the discretion available to them within those
   requirements to enact monitoring in a way that suits their
   organizational goals.},

Abstract = {As virtual teams constitute an important and pervasive organizational
   structure, research with the aim of improving the effectiveness of these
   teams is vital. Although critical topics such as conflict, coordination,
   and trust are being addressed, research on creativity in virtual teams
   has been quite limited. Given that creative solutions to complex
   problems create and sustain a firm's competitive advantage, an
   investigation of creativity in virtual teams is warranted. The goal of
   the current study is to explore the influences on creativity in
   asynchronous virtual teams. Predicated upon grounded theory, this
   exploration is accomplished through an in-depth qualitative analysis of
   the team communication transcripts of ten virtual teams. Teams were
   composed of graduate students who interacted solely via an asynchronous
   computer conferencing system to develop the high-level requirements and
   design for a new innovative product. Significant inhibitors to the
   creative performance of virtual teams included dominance, domain
   knowledge, downward norm setting, lack of shared understanding, time
   pressure, and technical difficulties. Significant enhancers to
   creativity included stimulating colleagues, the existence of a variety
   of social influences, a collaborative team climate, and both the
   surfacing and reduction of equivocality.},

Title = {Improving Technical and Risk Communication: An Organizational Study of
   North Carolina Emergency Management and Hurricane Florence},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background: The relationships between US government emergency management
   agencies and the public they serve are fraught with distrust and
   tension. This distrust can be attributed to past disaster responses and
   a lack of transparency with emergency information. Emergency managers
   work as technical communicators to share information through multiple
   platforms and digital spaces. Public trust can be increased by improving
   communication strategies within emergency management organizations.
   Literature review: Research to improve communication between emergency
   management agencies and the public calls for more trust and transparency
   within government organizations. However, little research has been
   conducted about the ways an organization's structure and workflow
   influence communication practices/strategies. Research questions: 1. How
   do emergency management organizations share information about natural
   disasters with the public? 2. How can communication strategies and
   workflow in emergency management organizations be improved? Research
   methodology: Clay Spinuzzi's topsight is used as a framework to conduct
   an organizational analysis of North Carolina Emergency Management (NCEM)
   response to Hurricane Florence in 2018. Interviews were conducted and
   artifacts were collected to investigate Spinuzzi's three levels of
   activity and create corresponding workflow diagrams. Results: Results
   indicate a need for standardized emergency management training and
   additional resources to support emergency managers. Interventions from
   technical and professional communicators can assist in developing
   communication strategies and problem-solving techniques. Conclusion:
   Developing informed communication strategies within an emergency
   management agency is a complex problem because of the numerous factors
   that play into the organizational structure and existing protocols.
   Technical communication scholars can help improve communication
   practices through local community outreach and additional organizational
   analyses.},

Abstract = {Background: This study focuses on how group communication affects group
   productivity. The specific scope of the study is pair programming. The
   study aims to discover whether intra-pair communication in pair
   programming has a significant impact on the pair programming process and
   output. Literature review: Many of the pair programming communication
   studies are descriptive and qualitative studies whose foci lay more on
   communication contents and alternative message deliveries. As a result,
   more research that focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of a person's
   communication skill level while performing a demanding task is needed.
   Research question: Does the communication competency level significantly
   impact pair programming output? Methodology: A pool of novice university
   programming students was deployed for the experiment. The Conversational
   Skills Rating Scale (CSRS) was used to categorize them into three
   cohorts-{''}high-high,{''} ``high-low,{''} and ``low-low.{''} The
   confounding variables were controlled. Results: No significant
   difference was found among the three cohorts in terms of their pair
   programming code output. Additionally, the post-experiment questionnaire
   responses revealed no significant difference in compatibility and
   confidence levels, but did show a significant difference in
   communication level. Conclusion: With all things being equal, a
   programmer's high communication skill level doesn't play a significant
   role in the programming output in a pair programming setting.},

Abstract = {Background: This study examined discourse during the problem resolution
   process in we-to-face technical-support interactions between
   technical-support providers and users at a helpdesk. Specifically, this
   study responds to the limited discourse-based research in
   technical-support interactions, despite the agreement that exploring
   communication within these interactions can help to improve them.
   Literature review: Research in technical communication has only begun to
   systematically explore the microlevel (smaller, moment-to-moment)
   communication in these interactions, though it has provided a
   well-established understanding of their macrolevel (genre) structure.
   Further, research has not completely explored how the two participants
   in the interaction work discursively to resolve technical problems and
   what strategies appear to promote user satisfaction. Research questions:
   1. What microlevel discourse do technical-support providers employ to
   resolve technical problems? 2. What microlevel discourse do users employ
   when collaborating with technical-support providers to resolve technical
   problems? 3. What microlevel discourse from both technical-support
   providers and users appears in satisfactory interactions? 4. What
   exchange patterns between the two participants appear in satisfactory
   interactions? Methodology: Using speech-act discourse analysis, this
   study examined 17 helpdesk interactions that resolved problems. These
   interactions occurred at a large, Midwestern US university helpdesk at
   which 11 instructors sought help with instructional technologies. Using
   a post-session survey completed by the users, I compared interactions
   with above- and below-average levels of user satisfaction to determine
   which microlevel discourse promoted user satisfaction with the help
   experience. Results: Technical-support providers employed signals
   announcing their thoughts and actions, gave explanations of the
   technology, and communicated confirmations or denials to user questions.
   Users employed inquiries about the technology, gave background
   information, and communicated confirmations or denials to
   technical-support provider questions. Statistically significant results
   about both speakers' discourse indicate that typical instructional
   strategies (such as explanations) do not necessarily characterize more
   satisfactory interactions. Instead, alternate forms of instruction
   (minimal responses or giving background information from personal
   experience) contribute toward satisfactory outcomes. Also, users'
   facility in asking follow-up questions or in giving further background
   information even during the problem-resolution stage appears to promote
   satisfaction. Further, a closer examination of the exchanges reveals how
   both participants interact in these ways. Conclusions: This study
   provides further insight into the typical instructional strategies
   identified by other researchers. Specifically, although explanations or
   directions do characterize problem resolution, these discourse
   strategies do not necessarily characterize distinctly satisfactory
   problem resolution. As one of the only studies of the functional
   discourse within technical-support interactions, this study provides
   researchers and practitioners further insight into how these important
   interactions work when technical-support providers resolve problems.},

Abstract = {Background: Swales's Create a Research Space (CaRS) is a popular model
   for writing research article (RA) introductions. CaRS prescribes three
   broad moves-establishing a territory, establishing a niche, and
   presenting the present work. This study assesses the applicability of a
   problem-solution patterns (PSP) approach to facilitate Move 1 in CaRS by
   analyzing RAs in materials science and engineering. Research questions:
   1. Is structuring an RA introduction using problem-solution patterns a
   common approach in published RAs in materials science and engineering?
   2. How does PSP facilitate the setting of boundaries between territory
   and niche in these RAs? Literature review: Variants of CaRS have been
   widely applied to study RA introductions. Even though the 2004 version
   of CaRS has been deemed effective in describing the structure of RA
   introductions in a number of disciplines, its prescription of Move 1 may
   not be easily operationalized in teaching engineering research writing.
   For problem-or application-based RAs, the territory can be established
   with PSP while preserving other CaRS moves. Methodology: This
   exploratory study employs a text analysis approach to assess 30 RA
   introductions from three materials science and engineering journals.
   Results and discussion: PSP is found in most RA introductions. By
   integrating PSP into CaRS, the proposed model can capture
   problem-solution cyclicity as a build-up move for territory and niche
   establishment. Conclusion: Because problem-solving is central to
   engineering research, RA introductions can be structured using
   naturally-occurring problem-solution patterns. PSP-CaRS may serve as an
   effective writing model for RA introductions in engineering-related
   fields.},

Title = {Plain-Style Preferences of US Professionals},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Although plain language is almost universally promoted by
   teachers of professional writing, editors, and communication
   professionals, some have argued that the effects of and preferences for
   plain style in written messages differ among groups of individuals.
   Research questions: 1. Do professionals prefer plain style? 2a. Do
   preferences differ for different categories of style? 2b. Do preferences
   differ for different groups of workers? Literature review: Style, the
   word-and sentence-level elements in a written text, is a critical
   element of plain language. There is evidence that plain style, however,
   affects readers differently based on their level of subject matter
   knowledge. Plain style is even criticized by a few. There is a long
   history of tensions surrounding linguistic prescriptivism, the notion
   that one manner of language use is superior to all others. Further,
   readers' preferences for writing style, plain or otherwise, may not be
   consistent across occupational positions, education levels,
   nationalities, personality types, or genders. Research methodology: We
   conducted a quantitative study of preferences for two major style
   categories (conciseness and word choice) using an online survey
   instrument. The student-recruiter technique provided us with usable
   responses from 614 working adults in the US. Using that data, we
   calculated proportions of respondents, with confidence intervals, who
   chose the plain-style options. We also used statistical tests to explore
   associations between preferences and respondent characteristics. Results
   and conclusions: Our findings support an overwhelming preference for
   plain style among US professionals who are native speakers of English.
   Reader preferences were stronger for elements associated with word
   choice than with conciseness. Those with lower education levels and
   blue-collar occupations had lower preferences for plain style. The study
   had two major limitations: 1. We investigated only two aspects of plain
   style rather than the full range of elements that make up plain
   language. 2. Our data-collection instrument presented readers with an
   artificial rather than an authentic reading experience. Future research
   may investigate the role of personality on stylistic preferences and the
   attributions readers make about writers based on their style.},

Title = {Teaching and Learning in Cross-Disciplinary Virtual Teams},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {58},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Background: Virtual teams collaborate across distances using information
   communication technologies (ICTs). A distinctive set of communication
   skills is needed by people who work successfully in virtual teams, and
   few universities or companies provide structured education and training
   in virtual teamwork. At a midsized southeastern Masters Comprehensive
   University, professors from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business,
   and Education came together to explore how they might use
   cross-disciplinary student teams (groups comprised of students with
   different backgrounds and educational goals) to teach concepts in their
   own disciplines while providing students with the opportunity to become
   more proficient in virtual team communication. Research questions: (1)
   Can cross-disciplinary student team projects successfully support
   learning in virtual team communication as well as address the learning
   objectives of specific courses? (2) What can faculty learn from a
   cross-disciplinary teaching model that can be applied to virtual teams?
   Situating the case: Experiential learning is based on performing real
   tasks and reflecting on that process; it benefits learners by engaging
   them in complex, authentic situations. Virtual teams are significant
   because they support a great deal of the work currently taking place in
   our global economy; they are significant in higher education because
   students need to develop skills in international virtual communication
   before they are introduced to high-stakes work environments. In previous
   cases, students have collaborated across national cultures to develop
   project deliverables, such as websites, reports, and usability studies
   and present them in virtual environments using such tools as WebEx,
   Skype, and live streaming. How this case was studied: The findings from
   this case are based on individual student reflections, which were used
   to create a data matrix for each project, and instructor observation and
   evaluation. About the case: In Spring 2013, six faculty from the same
   university worked together to incorporate virtual teams into their
   classrooms. These six faculty members were divided into two groups of
   three with each group representing three colleges mentioned earlier. The
   faculty developed two interdisciplinary projects (one on infographics
   and another on social media) that enabled rich and diverse student
   collaboration. In both groups, the three faculty leaders worked together
   to define a project scope that students could achieve and that would
   relate to learning goals in each discipline. Conclusions: The lessons
   learned from this experience are that: (1) technical challenges will
   occur; (2) students from all disciplines must receive the same
   information; (3) instructors must balance respect for their colleagues
   and support for their students; (4) team assignments need to be
   consistent and fair; (5) instructors need to establish appropriate and
   fair assessment measurements for their own students; and (6) projects
   need to be realistic in order to show the students the value of virtual

Abstract = {Research problem: Tutorials and user manuals are important forms of
   impersonal support for using software applications, including electronic
   medical records (EMRs). Differences between user-and vendor-generated
   documentation may indicate support needs, which are not sufficiently
   addressed by the official documentation, and reveal new elements that
   may inform the design of tutorials and user manuals. Research question:
   What are the differences between user-generated tutorials and manuals
   for an EMR and the official user manual from the software vendor?
   Literature review: Effective design of tutorials and user manuals
   requires careful packaging of information, balance between declarative
   and procedural texts, an action and task-oriented approach, support for
   error recognition and recovery, and effective use of visual elements. No
   previous research compared these elements between formal and informal
   documents. Methodology: We conducted a mixed-methods study. Seven
   tutorials and two manuals for an EMR were collected from three family
   health teams and compared with the official user manual from the
   software vendor. Documents were qualitatively analyzed using a framework
   analysis approach in relation to the principles of technical
   documentation described before. Subsets of the data were quantitatively
   analyzed using cross-tabulation to compare the types of error
   information and visual cues in screen captures between user-and
   vendor-generated manuals. Results and discussion: The user-developed
   tutorials and manuals differed from the vendor-developed manual in that
   they contained mostly procedural and not declarative information; were
   customized to the specific workflow, user roles, and patient
   characteristics; contained more error information related to work
   processes than software usage; and used explicit visual cues on screen
   captures to help users identify window elements. These findings imply
   that to support EMR implementation, tutorials and manuals need to be
   customized and adapted to specific organizational contexts and
   workflows. The main limitation of the study is its generalizability.
   Future research should address this limitation and may explore
   alternative approaches to software documentation, such as modular
   manuals or participatory design.},

Title = {Intercultural Communication Training in IT Outsourcing Companies in
   India: A Case Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {262-274},

Abstract = {Background: This study examines the nature, manifestations and causes of
   communication problems in international outsourcing engagements.
   Specifically, it explores a case of business process outsourcing (BPO),
   which is the transfer of a number of business processes, such as
   payroll, supply chain management, and customer relations to an external
   supplier. In this case, a company based in the US outsourced its
   business processes to a company in India. Research questions: (1) If
   widespread proficiency in English is the reason for India's predominant
   position in outsourcing, then why do we hear about communication
   problems? (2) What are the causes of such problems? (3) In what forms
   and situations do they manifest? (4) How could technical communication
   offer solutions to ameliorate or minimize some of these communication
   problems? Situating the case: Similar cases studied include previous
   studies of call centers in the Philippines and outsourcing relationships
   in software companies have identified challenges in those relationships
   to problems of intercultural communications, such as language use and
   differences in culture. Three areas of inquiry informed this study.
   Intercultural communication theories provide frameworks and touch points
   for assessing the role of culture in communication. Previous studies of
   outsourcing and offshoring provided definitions of the broad range of
   arrangements that comprise outsourcing. Although these studies all
   concluded that communication is a crucial factor in the success of
   outsourced projects, they offered few details of communication problems,
   their causes, manifestations, and possible solutions. Accounts of India
   represent India as a rapidly-growing, dynamic economy with certain
   typical communication problems. Methodology: The study was designed as a
   mixed-methods, single-case study with a mix of quantitative and
   qualitative methods. Quantitative data were gathered through surveys
   that helped develop a picture of patterns in areas such as communication
   problems, preferred methods of communication, and patterns of escalation
   while qualitative data from 45 personal interviews and one group
   interview provided insights into the nature and resolution of
   communication dissonances. About the case: The case studied ABC
   Corporation, a captive Indian company that performed BPO for a major
   American corporation. Communication problems that arise in the
   outsourcing relationship include differences in corporate culture and
   differences in linguistic and rhetorical choices. Issues causing these
   problems include differences in education and training. Conclusions:
   Ongoing training in cross-cultural communication is needed at all stages
   of the outsourcing cycle, with an emphasis on communication skills in
   the early stages of the process, especially the hiring stage. Technical
   communication can offer solutions to these problems because our field
   can help structure suitable training applying theories such as Cross'
   Theory of centripetal and centrifugal forces, which provide frameworks
   for assessing and addressing communication problems.},

Title = {Achieving Experiential Cross-cultural Training Through a Virtual Teams
   Project Teaching Case},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-286},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research questions: How can our current knowledge of experiential
   learning be applied to cross-cultural web-based training? How do
   postproject interviews with the participants advance our knowledge about
   experiential learning? What practical recommendations for teachers and
   trainers can be offered based on this and similar case studies?
   Situating the case: Literature on virtual teams stipulates the
   importance of teaching leadership development within teams, including
   methods of conflict resolution, and flexibility in methods and tools of
   communication. Literature on experiential learning places a high value
   on learner experience, and on indirect and combined methods of assessing
   experiential learning projects. Methodology: The case was studied
   through the analysis of data obtained from unstructured class interviews
   with three of the US-based participants of the teaching project.
   Interview participants were chosen to ensure a variety of responses
   about their experiences while taking part in the project. About the
   case: The project was a part of an introductory graduate-level seminar
   in technical and scientific communication. Graduate students in
   technical communication from the US and graduate students in marketing
   from Ukraine participated in the project. The participants worked in
   virtual teams to create collaborative analyses of localized versions of
   websites of transnational corporations. The findings of this research
   are as follows. (1) Virtual teams work more effectively when given time
   to build trust and connections among participants. (2) Virtual teams
   work more effectively when time is devoted to the development of leaders
   and the articulation of leadership responsibilities within teams. (3)
   Experiential learning team participants use a variety of communication
   tools depending on the nature of the communicative task at hand. (4) As
   part of the learning process, virtual team members recognized and
   attempted to adjust to cultural and professional discourse differences
   between countries and professional fields.},

Abstract = {In the increasingly competitive global economy, corporations throughout
   the world must take advantage of all the marketing and communication
   tools available to them, including blogging. Blogs allow corporations to
   connect with their stakeholders in a more personal way and, thus,
   strengthen their image, brand, and customer loyalty. Instant feedback is
   available through comments posted on the corporate blog, saving
   organizations large sums of money otherwise spent on market research.
   However, entering the blogosphere poses a number of risks for a
   corporation, such as potential damage to the corporate reputation and
   customer loyalty as well as legal liability. Conflicts still exist
   between the rights of bloggers and a corporation's interests. Blogs may
   be restricted by legal and ethical boundaries, which may differ across
   countries. This paper presents the benefits and risks associated with
   corporate blogging around the world and provides some interesting
   success stories as well as lessons learned. It also offers a compilation
   of guidelines for effective blogging and suggests topics for future
   research.},

Abstract = {This paper applies Media Richness Theory and Social Influence Theory in
   different countries where the significance of media is uniquely shaped
   by tire culture. In particular we focus on whether Media Richness Theory
   and Social Influence Theory hold for communication between subordinates
   and supervisors in different cultures. To test this hypothesis, a
   comparative cross cultural field study with knowledge workers (n = 120)
   in the telecommunication industry in the United States and South Korea
   was conducted. This study demonstrates that country, task equivocality,
   and communication direction are the factors that affect individuals'
   media choice. Communication direction was found to be the strongest
   factor influencing media choice for Korean employees, whereas task
   equivocality was the dominant factor influencing media choice for LIS
   employees. This study also demonstrates the influence of national
   culture on media choice among US and Korean employees. Implications for
   both theory and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Modern communication technology has greatly increased the number of
   options we can choose among in a variety of evolutionarily important
   domains, from housing to food to mates. But is this greater choice
   beneficial? To find out, we ran two experimental studies to examine the
   effects of increasing option set-size on anticipated and experienced
   choice perceptions in the modern context of online mate choice. While
   participants expected greater enjoyment, increased satisfaction, and
   less regret when choosing from larger (versus smaller) sets of
   prospective partners (at least up to a point; Study 1), participants
   presented with a supposedly ideal number of options experienced no
   improvement in affect and showed more memory confusions regarding their
   choice than did those participants presented with fewer options (Study
   2). Participants correctly anticipated that greater choice would yield
   increasing costs, but they overestimated the point at which this would
   occur. We offer an evolutionary-cognitive framework within which to
   understand this misperception, discuss factors that may make it
   difficult for decision-makers to correct for it, and suggest ways in
   which datin websites could be designed to help users choose from large
   option sets.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of information communication technologies
   (ICT) over the past decade, the nature of how organization members
   communicate has changed, becoming far more complex and challenging.
   Communication risks brought about by technology-mediated communication
   can sometimes be detrimental to the overall organizational function and
   success. We classify these communication risks into three types:
   reception, understanding, and action risks.
   We propose the notion of COMMUNICATION PORTFOLIO which refers to a
   single ICT or a specific combination of ICTs that can be used to manage
   any perceived risk of communication. Specifically, this study aims to
   examine the relationship between perceived risks (i.e., risk of
   reception, risk of understanding, and risk of action) in the
   communication. process and the dimensions (i.e., size, content, and
   structuring mechanism) of the communication portfolio usedfor
   communication. We also identify communication riskfactors that may
   accentuate the different types of risks. We develop a communication risk
   Perceptionframework to illustrate the relationship between the
   communication risk factors, the different types of communication risks,
   and the communication portfolio. Finally, we illustrate how the
   communication risk perceptionframework can be applied in a real-life
   natural setting by using the shuttle Challenger incident as an example.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to learn about readers' ability to
   logically comprehend sequential procedural instructions, presented as
   isolated graphic frames. Further, this study sought to find out how text
   and graphical aids can help comprehension. The 20 participants in this
   study received a stack of graphic cutouts demonstrating the action in a
   sequential assembly process. Readers had to sequentially order the
   collection of unordered graphics with either supporting text describing
   the action or supporting graphics showing the completed action. Results
   showed that readers often falter when process information is not
   presented as part of a configuration and also falter often at points
   where they need to comprehend instructions demonstrating transitions
   between subassemblies. Further data also showed that performance was
   better with outcome graphics as an aid than with text as an aid,
   although the difference was not statistically significant.},

Abstract = {Various disciplines have extensively studied deception in human
   communication. With the increasing use of instant messaging (IM) for
   both informal communication and task performance in the work place,
   deception in IM is emerging as an important issue. In this study, we
   explored the behavioral indicators of deception in a group IM setting.
   The empirical results showed that three types of nonverbal behaviors and
   three types of verbal behaviors that were investigated could
   significantly differentiate deceivers from truth tellers. The findings
   potentially can broaden our knowledge of deception behavior in human
   communication and improve deception awareness and deception detection in
   the cyberspace.},

Title = {The Communication Coefficient Method: A New Faculty Grading Tool
   Designed to Help Engineering Students Improve Their Technical
   Communication},

Abstract = {Introduction: Engineering students benefit from understanding the role
   of technical communication in the professional workplace. This article
   examines the communication coefficient (CC), a new method for grading
   student technical communication intended to help students better
   understand this role. Its goal is to encourage students to treat their
   communication with the same importance that it has in the professional
   workplace. About the case: The core philosophy of the CC method is that
   audiences perceive technical work more positively when it is
   communicated well and more negatively when it is not. The method
   captures this philosophy mathematically: students' grades result from
   multiplying the points earned for technical content by a number-the
   coefficient-representing how well they communicated that content.
   Situating the case: The CC method is rooted in established principles,
   such as holistic grading and the separate yet simultaneous consideration
   of content and communication. It is novel in how it combines these
   principles into a grading technique. Approach: The CC method was
   employed in three undergraduate engineering classes at the United States
   Military Academy during the spring 2020 semester. Student and instructor
   feedback were collected to gauge the pros and cons of the method and
   whether it is worth fielding on a larger scale. Discussion: The CC
   method was found to encourage better student communication, although
   mixed student and instructor opinion suggest that changes to the method
   and the way that it is messaged are necessary. Conclusion: The CC method
   warrants further study and consideration of its usefulness in other
   departments and institutions.},

Abstract = {Background: The proliferation and penetration of social media into
   professional and everyday lives have reshaped the way in which people
   deal with their personal information and call for refreshed perceptions
   and conceptualizations of the power relationship between individual
   users and technology giants. Despite intensified privacy concerns and
   crises over social media, there is little research on the correlations
   between users' privacy perception and protection in non-Western
   settings. Research question: To what extent are Hong Kong Facebook users
   willing to sacrifice control over their information in exchange for
   self-expression, sociality, and intimacy in their social roles and
   relationships? Literature review: We first identified a gap in the
   literature on user perceptions and concerns over privacy in Eastern
   cultures, which is scarce despite the increasing concern over privacy in
   professional communication. Informed by the recent literature on the
   privacy paradox and Foucault and Deleuze's work on power, the unbalanced
   and normalizing power relationship between Facebook and its users in
   Eastern contexts is identified as a synthesis of discipline and control.
   Research methodology: Data from a survey of 797 young users in Hong Kong
   were used for our analysis of privacy perception and protection. The
   survey contained three sections: Facebook usage, attitudes and
   behaviors, and basic demographics. Results: The findings support our
   hypotheses in revealing that the privacy paradox is evident for Facebook
   users in Hong Kong. In addition, excessive Facebook use leads to
   reactive privacy awareness and normalization behaviors. Conclusion: We
   believe that technology giants, such as Facebook, should be pioneers in
   safeguarding users' privacy while encouraging the establishment of
   social relationships and freedom of expression. The implications for
   internet governance are discussed from a multistakeholder perspective.},

Abstract = {Background: Self-disclosure on social media can cause some privacy
   risks, but it benefits users and businesses if adequately managed.
   Companies may benefit from users' self-disclosure on social media to
   better understand the consumers' needs, customize services or products,
   and address users' concerns to sculpt positive brand reputation, trust,
   and sales. In addition, users' better understanding of self-disclosure
   motivations helps them manage more suitable topic, platform, and
   concepts to match the intended online personal or professional persona.
   Finally, technical communicators' understanding of the motivation for
   social media self-disclosures can help them leverage available
   self-disclosure in producing more effective technical communication and
   carefully plan self-disclosures with clear motivations. Literature
   review: Many researchers have studied the varying self-disclosure
   motivations, but to the best of our knowledge, no mapping studies are
   currently available summarizing the motivations of self-disclosure on
   social media. Research question: What does the current research about
   self-disclosure identify as users' motivation for self-disclosure on
   social media? Research methodology: We conducted a systematic mapping
   study that included relevant journal and conference publications.
   Mapping studies are suitable for structuring a broad research field
   concerning research questions about content, methods, or trends in the
   existing publications. Results: We found four categories for social
   media self-disclosures: discloser-related, audience-related, platform-
   and affordances-related, and perceived risk- and cost-related. Within
   the main categories, we found varying submotivations. We also discuss
   the implications of our findings and future research needs. Conclusions:
   The mapping of available studies helps researchers, academics, and
   practitioners understand existing self-disclosure motivations and
   research gaps. In addition, social media stakeholders planning to use
   social media self-disclosures within their areas of interest can use
   this study as a starting point to understand what drives social media
   self-disclosures.},

Abstract = {Background: Resume preparation is a common activity within technical
   writing classes, but the advent and increased use of resume profile and
   job-hunting sites, such as Indeed.com, require instructors and
   researchers to re-think common practices in the teaching of resume
   writing, particularly for writing instructors with limited disciplinary
   experience. Prior research for conventional resumes has quantified the
   disciplinarity of resumes as a function of resume quality using metrics
   of disciplinary discourse density, which may be useful in analyzing
   online resumes profiles. Research questions: 1. How do online
   engineering resume profiles demonstrate disciplinarity? 2. What
   formatting and stylistic conventions are observed within engineering
   resume profiles? 3. How do rhetorical disciplinarity and conventions
   vary with resume profile quality? Literature review: Although past
   efforts have examined the resume as a critical genre for entering a
   professional setting, few researchers have sought to interpret the
   relationships between discursive and stylistic expectations and quality
   in online resume profiles, while also accounting for aspects of
   disciplinarity. Methodology: This study compares engineering (all
   disciplines) resume profiles from Indeed.com with a corpus of
   conventional engineering resumes through qualitative genre analysis and
   quantitative methods for calculating disciplinary discourse density. We
   also characterize stylistic and rhetorical conventions for resume
   profiles, and statistically compare these facets as a function of resume
   quality. Results and conclusion: Results determined that discursive
   strategies were significantly different between strong, moderate, and
   weak engineering resume profiles. Qualitative analysis captured
   differences in style and form that were also statistically linked with
   quality. Based on our results, we call for further investigation into
   resume profiles and reconsideration of current pedagogical approaches.},

Title = {Trajectories in Turmoil: A Case Study of Engineering Students' Reactions
   to Disruptions in Their Community of Practice},

Abstract = {Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to
   universities when instruction had to shift entirely online. Universities
   were quick to survey their students about those challenges, and
   education researchers are now focused on building more effective online
   experiences based on student feedback. About the case: The loss of
   in-person instruction was difficult for engineering students in
   practice-based courses as they lost the courses' hands-on aspect, which
   is essential for reinforcing theoretical concepts. They also lost the
   support provided through daily interactions with their peers and
   instructors. Situating the case: Students in a required four-course
   practice-based mechanical engineering sequence shared their perspectives
   via reflective portfolio essays on how shifting to online instruction
   affected their ability to participate in their learning communities and
   negotiate meaningful learning experiences. Methods/approach: Through
   thematic analysis of the reflective essays, we applied the lens of
   communities of practice to put the students' responses into context.
   Results/discussion: The students' concerns varied depending on their
   position in the course sequence and the course; however, most students
   felt that the loss of in-person interaction was most detrimental and
   disruptive in the transition to online instruction and yielded
   communication and teaming issues. Implications and conclusions: Five
   implications arose from the results of this study, including recognizing
   the unique challenges of online learning in practice-based courses,
   instructing students in virtual communication tools, exercising empathy,
   being mindful of cognitive load, and researching self-directed learners
   in online environments. In addition, faculty should consider the
   importance of students' communities of practice and build opportunities
   to maintain and strengthen the bonds of those communities within their
   courses, both online and face to face. They should also add more
   opportunities for virtual interaction early in the curriculum to build
   digital communication skills, which will undoubtedly be required in
   their careers.},

Abstract = {Research problem: With the extensive use of the internet, cyber language
   management has become a critical issue for international organizations
   (IOs). IOs' language choices on their official websites represent the
   very interests of member nations and form a key factor in organizational
   image construction. However, research on IOs' cyber language management
   is rather limited. Literature review: Previous studies examined the use
   of different languages on websites of large corporations, state
   institutions, and organizations that aim to reach linguistically diverse
   populations, but discussions of language management of international
   organizations generally focus on traditional offline language policies.
   This article attempts to examine the choices of languages on IOs'
   official websites. Research questions: 1. What languages are used on
   international organizations' official websites? 2. How do
   intergovernmental organizations differ from nongovernmental
   organizations in such language choices and cyber language management?
   Methodology: Data from the official websites of 50 intergovernmental
   organizations (IGOs) and 20 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were
   collected, and both qualitative and quantitative approaches were adopted
   to analyze the data. Results: The findings show that English is the
   dominant language on IOs' official websites, and is especially preferred
   by NGOs; inconsistency of IOs' cyber language policy is found among the
   languages used on specific pages, e-documents, and the general available
   languages; and IGOs' language choices are more diversified, unified, and
   standardized than NGOs'. Conclusion: Accordingly, the effect of
   technology on IOs' language policy is further analyzed, and suggestions
   for IOs' language management are presented concerning the linguistic
   ecology at supra-national levels.},

Abstract = {Introduction: ABET has approved changes to the EAC's Criterion 3 that
   will take effect for the 2019-2020 accreditation cycle. Among many
   changes and rearrangements is the introduction of the term ``engineering
   judgment{''} as one of the competencies that students must develop to
   prepare for professional engineering. Literature review: However,
   engineering judgment is not defined in the criterion, and although it is
   a ubiquitous concept in the philosophy of engineering and engineering
   education, little empirical investigation has been undertaken into the
   practice of engineering judgment. And there is even less conceptual or
   empirical investigation into communication's role in the practice of
   engineering judgment. Research questions: 1. What does engineering
   judgment look like in practice? 2. How does the sociotechnical situation
   affect engineering judgment? 3. What role does rhetoric have, not only
   in communicating judgments, but in forming them as well? 4. How can
   teachers and practitioners in engineering and technical communication
   use these findings to facilitate better judgment in the classroom and at
   work? Methods: Using videotape and fieldnotes, the author examines the
   two sequences of decision-making from a student engineering design
   project. An ethnomethodologically inspired framework is used to exhibit
   the phenomenal details of ``doing{''} engineering judgment.
   Discussion/conclusion: Data reveal that engineering judgment may be
   fruitfully understood by educators as not just a cognitive and
   individual ability to apply technical knowledge, but instead a capacity
   of participants to rhetorically establish common cause to interrogate
   and reflect on the relations between technical data and situations.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of the study was to fill gaps in our
   knowledge about technical editors' work practices and perceptions,
   knowledge that might be useful for teachers and practitioners, as well
   as current and prospective students. Research questions: (1) What work
   activities do technical editors engage in? (2) How do people become and
   progress in careers as technical editors? (3) What do technical editors
   perceive about the complexity of their work and its value to themselves
   and others? Literature review: The literature review focuses on previous
   surveys of technical editors, which have tended to focus on
   technology-related issues and been largely limited to samples obtained
   from the Society for Technical Communication. Methodology: A link to an
   online survey was sent to 32 professional organizations for technical
   and other professional, nonliterary, and nonjournalism editors. The
   leadership of each organization was asked to forward the link to its
   members; 12 complied, with a resulting 253 respondents. Responses to
   closed-ended questions were tabulated, while responses to the open-ended
   questions were analyzed thematically. Results and conclusions: The
   results revealed a broad range of job titles, disciplinary and
   professional fields, genres and media, editing-related tasks, and extent
   and type of collaboration. Respondents perceived as useful several forms
   of academic preparation, personality traits, and attitudes. About half
   the respondents had become editors through deliberate preparation during
   college (direct route) and half had not (indirect route). Thus, one
   implication of the results is that college students majoring in the
   sciences and other technical fields (indirect route) might be attracted
   to complementary minors and certificate programs in technical
   communication/editing. The sample was obtained from among a broader
   range of technical editors than samples used in previous surveys but was
   relatively small and, therefore, nongeneralizable. Future surveys should
   strive for a larger sample size and include questions about a wide range
   of demographic variables that can be correlated with the independent
   variables.},

Title = {A User-Centered Design Approach to Self-Service Ticket Vending Machines},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Since their introduction, self-service ticket vending machines (TVMs)
   have become an increasingly important distribution channel in the public
   transport sector, progressively replacing the traditional ticket
   counter. In a public transport setting, where ticket counter closures
   have left different groups of people dependent on TVM to meet their
   mobility needs, a single, effective system is required. Research
   questions: (1) Which barriers do currently hinder the usage of TVM? (2)
   Which requirements should a barrier-free TVM fulfill? (3) How can we
   design a new self-service TVM for a nationwide public railway company?
   (4) How can we ensure that the usability and user experience (UX) is
   high for all users, especially for those with low levels of
   technological affinity? Situating the case: Most other studies on the
   use and usability of TVMs were conducted as post-hoc evaluations. In
   contrast, our case study presents a user-centered design (UCD) approach
   that takes the needs of the different target groups into account
   throughout the whole development process. Theories and concepts that
   guided the case included UCD, which involves alternating test and
   evaluation loops that actively involve users to create a usable product
   and UX, which describes the quality of the experience a person has when
   interacting with a specific computer system using a specific interaction
   technique. Methodology: More than 250 participants were involved in
   focus groups, observations, interviews, and experiments from the very
   first stages of development. Interface designs were presented to the
   future end users to obtain their feedback, with the results fed back
   into the design process. About the case: A prototype for a novel
   generation of TVM was developed in three phases: First, the context of
   use was analyzed. In the second phase, we conducted a requirements
   analysis. Third, different hardware and software interaction designs
   were iteratively tested and evaluated. The resulting prototype met the
   requirements of most user groups, though further adjustments are
   necessary. Conclusions: The UCD approach proved to be a valuable
   framework for the development and design of self-service systems.},

Title = {The Role of Leadership and Contextualization on Citizenship Behaviors in
   Distributed Teams: A Relational Capital Perspective},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {4},
Pages = {310-324},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research problem: This study provides insights into the role that a
   leader plays in improving relational capital, thereby motivating team
   members' citizenship behaviors in distributed teams. We address the
   following research questions: (1) What is the role of inspirational
   leadership in cultivating relational capital (i.e., reciprocity and
   commitment) in distributed teams? (2) Are team members' citizenship
   behaviors (i.e., knowledge sharing and interpersonal helping) influenced
   by relational capital in distributed teams? (3) How does technology
   support for cognitive and affective contextualization facilitate leaders
   to improve organizational communication? Literature review: The purpose
   of the review was to provide a theoretical background for the variables
   in this study. Based on the relevant theories on relational capital,
   leadership, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and
   contextualization, this study reviewed how previous studies link these
   theories to one other, and proposed the positive relationship between
   leadership, relational capital and OCBs, as well as the moderating
   relationships of technology support for contextualization. Methodology:
   The researchers conducted a quantitative survey with 141 respondents in
   a major university in Asia. The subjects were part-time graduate
   students pursuing their master's degree. Researchers administrated a
   paper-based questionnaire along with a cover letter explaining the
   study's objectives. Responses indicating teams that were situated in
   only one location and their role as team leaders were removed from the
   analyses. Participation was completely voluntary. The researchers chose
   partial least squares to test the hypotheses since it has fewer
   restrictive assumptions and its ability for analyzing measurement and
   structural models. Results and discussion: This study highlights the
   importance of inspirational leaders in cultivating two kinds of
   relational capital, namely commitment and reciprocity. This study also
   explores the differential values of contextual information from the
   cognitive and affective dimensions. A key result is that the effect of
   inspirational leadership on reciprocity is strengthened when there is
   technology support for cognitive contextualization. At the same time,
   technology support for affective contextualization has a direct impact
   on commitment. These findings provide empirical support for affective
   and cognitive contextualization in distributed organizational
   communication, and suggest a way for distinguishing between reciprocity
   and commitment. This study concludes by illustrating the positive
   effects of commitment on citizenship behaviors, such as knowledge
   sharing and interpersonal helping. The implication of this study is that
   when teams are physically dispersed, there should be more emphasis on
   leadership with inspirational attributes to get their team members to
   perform beyond standard requirements. In addition, this study provides
   leaders and organizations with an opportunity to reflect on the
   appropriate technology that can be adopted to compensate for
   insufficient communication. The limitation of this study is that each
   respondent represents his/her working team. As a result, it may
   introduce bias to the findings. In addition, self-reported measures may
   also cause common method bias. Future research could consider the
   addition of objective measures and longitudinal work to reduce the
   possibility of common method bias, and investigate how work behaviors
   change over time.},

Title = {Different Approaches to Similar Challenges: An Analysis of the
   Occupational Cultures of the Disciplines of Technical Communication and
   Training},

Abstract = {Problem: Perhaps it is presumptuous of technical communicators to assume
   that, because some of their skills that might be employed in developing
   and delivering training materials, that those skills alone are
   qualifications to work in training, much less the source by which the
   processes of Training might be examined. Using data from one survey and
   one interview-based study of the work of Technical communication and
   Training groups, as well as participation on committees responsible for
   certification examinations for technical communicators and trainers,
   this tutorial analyzes differences in the occupational cultures of the
   two fields. Key concepts: The work differs: technical communicators
   produce content that explains how to perform tasks; trainers produce
   programs that develop skills that a third party can verify. To do so,
   technical communicators follow a process that emphasizes writing and
   production; trainers follow a process that emphasizes the analysis of
   intended goals and evaluation of whether those goals have been achieved.
   The guiding philosophy of Technical communication is usability; the
   guiding philosophy of Training is performance. Although both disciplines
   are rooted in cognitive psychology, the primary intellectual roots of
   Technical communication are in rhetoric and composition, while the
   primary intellectual roots are in education. The preferred research
   methods of Technical communication are critical; the preferred research
   methods of trainers are empirical qualitative and quantitative methods.
   Key lessons: As a result, Technical communication professionals and
   researchers who want to work in training should approach the field in a
   culturally appropriate way by (1) recognizing distinctions between a
   communication product and a training program, (2) recognizing
   distinctions in work processes, (3) recognizing distinctions in
   language, (4) recognizing differences in values, and (5) acknowledging
   that an academic discipline of training exists.},

Abstract = {Engineering teams are often globally distributed and comprise
   participants from multiple disciplines and cultures who rely on
   professional communication support. Companies, organizations, and
   institutions increasingly embrace these virtual teams and use a variety
   of information and communication technologies to support synchronous and
   asynchronous team interaction (e.g., chat, videoconferencing, email,
   group support systems, instant messaging, and forums). More and more,
   communication takes place without being face-to-face. Students should be
   prepared for such a workplace. However, it is difficult to emulate the
   specifics of real-world projects in a 100-hour university course. One
   way to bring the real world into the classroom is by combining the
   efforts of 100 Students into a 10,000-hour project. This paper describes
   the Hong Kong-Netherlands project (HKNet) as an example of an integrated
   learning activity among multiple international institutions that brings
   the reality of engineering management with professional communication
   into educational contexts. Virtual teams comprising students from
   different parts of the world build websites on specific software topics
   that are then integrated into a single product. HKNet has entered its
   tenth year, and over 1000 students have participated.},

Abstract = {Channel expansion theory predicts positive relationships between
   knowledge-building experiences and perceptions of a medium's capacity
   for conveying complex information. To date, channel expansion has only
   been tested in a pair of studies focused upon perceptions of a single
   medium-email. The present investigation replicates the initial tests of
   channel expansion theory, assesses the validity of the theory for two
   additional media, examines whether differences in media explain
   additional variation in richness perceptions, and analyzes the
   relationships between expansion predictors and dimensions of richness
   across three media. Data from 529 organizational media users revealed
   the following: (1) knowledge-building experiences with a medium,
   communication partner, topic, and social influences are positively
   related to perceptions of a medium's richness, (2) these relationships
   are fairly consistent across email, telephone, and face-to face, (3)
   differences in richness are attributable to differences between media,
   and (4) expansion variables appear to be selectively related to richness
   dimensions and these relationships vary across media.},

Abstract = {Electronic collaboration has become a driver for productivity as
   organizations develop linkages for the planning, sourcing, and execution
   of goods and services. These organizations require mechanisms to harness
   the diverse and personalized intellectual resources that are distributed
   across the world. While electronic collaboration technologies have made
   it possible to harness intellectual resources across space and time,
   knowledge management is locked in a paradox of perception-the more
   valuable a knowledge resource is seen to be, the less it is shared. This
   paper develops a framework for the activation of knowledge that relies
   on a view of knowledge as identity. The analysis of a case study reveals
   activation conditions that delineate processes in which electronic
   collaboration technologies can be most effective. This has implications
   for the creation of collaborative work environments that enhance
   knowledge activation in organizations.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a conceptual framework for exploring significant
   differences in how people from diverse cultural backgrounds and with
   diverse individual characteristics might perceive and use web documents.
   This is the first stage of a large multistage empirical study of user
   satisfaction and effectiveness of various web designs based on cultural
   and individual factors. We identify six cultural factors and six
   individual factors that could impact the effectiveness of web documents.
   The six cultural factors include: pouter distance, individualism versus
   collectivism, masculinity versus femininity, anxiety avoidance,
   long-term versus short-term orientation, and polychronic versus
   monochronic time orientation. The six individual factors include:
   demographics (age and gender), professional knowledge, information
   technology knowledge, flexibility, information processing abilities, and
   cultural knowledge. Based on the conceptual model proposed in this
   paper, we develop a number of testable, specific propositions on how web
   document effectiveness could be impacted by the cultural and individual
   factors in various web designs. In order to measure document
   effectiveness of each design, we identify components of web document
   effectiveness as perceived usability, reliability, clarity, and
   comprehension that, in turn, influence readers' overall satisfaction
   with web documents. Using the propositions presented here, one can
   measure and analyze how cultural and individual factors influence users'
   satisfaction, which will assist researchers, educators, and
   communicators working with various web designs.},

Abstract = {In usability testing of websites, thinking aloud is a frequently used
   method. A fundamental discussion, however; about the relation between
   the use of different variants of thinking aloud and the evaluation goals
   for this specific medium is still lacking, To lay a foundation for this
   discussion, I analyzed the results of three usability studies in which
   different thinking-aloud tasks were used: ct simple searching task, an
   application task, and a prediction task. In the task setting the profile
   of the Web-surfer the communication goal of the website and other
   quality aspects are taken into account. The qualitative analysis of
   these studies shows that the task variation has some influence on the
   results of usability testing and that, consequently, tasks should be
   matched with the evaluation goals put forward.},

Title = {Embodying Public Feminisms: Collaborative Intersectional Models for
   Engagement},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Introduction: This article offers an approach that we call critical
   collaboration -an array of theoretical commitments drawn from the
   authors' embodiments and lived experiences. In making explicit the
   connections between authorial embodiment and the content of theory and
   practice, our practical models demonstrate new and varied approaches to
   public feminisms. We begin with a discussion of embodiment and then
   offer four sections-amplification rhetorics, apparent feminisms, a
   techne of marginality, and memetic rhetorical environments-with key
   takeaways to guide readers through our related-but-different approaches.
   Our goal in doing so is to underscore the importance of public feminisms
   to enacting social justice in technical and professional communication.
   This means recognizing our obligation to respond to unjust technical
   communication. Technical communication is not a utopia of inclusion and
   anti-racism-although some corners of the field are dedicated to those
   topics, to be sure. Rather, despite the social justice turn, some parts
   of the field still insist on objectivity, neutrality, and practicality
   as the touchstones for ``good{''} technical communication. Our work here
   shows some of the ways in which we might resist the cultural blinders
   that allow such ideas to persist unabated. Drawing especially on
   research in rhetoric and embodiment studies, we build interdisciplinary
   bridges with critical race studies (including critical race feminisms),
   womanism, gender studies, technical communication, Black rhetorics,
   queer studies, cultural studies, and rhetorical genre studies, among
   other fields, to provide a set of practical approaches to public
   feminist exigencies that resist collapsing all feminisms into a single
   approach. We argue that drawing on embodiment to develop a multiplicity
   of feminist approaches and engaging in critical collaboration as those
   approaches evolve is a way forward that allows for more stakeholders to
   engage fruitfully in public feminist projects. Our hope is that readers
   can then imagine public feminisms as one avenue for doing the social
   justice work that is vital to the growth of technical and professional
   communication as a field.},

Abstract = {Introduction: As technical and professional communication (TPC) becomes
   increasingly networked, students must learn to work cross-culturally.
   However, these skills can be difficult to develop. We report on a
   service-learning project aimed at helping students write and design for
   an audience in India. About the case: The authors saw a need to provide
   course materials to practitioners in India that became an opportunity to
   involve students in global content creation. This teaching case reports
   on two courses designed collaboratively to teach design and
   communication skills through service-learning, while providing course
   content to Indian practitioners of TPC. Situating the case: Technical
   communication has a long history of teaching writing skills for the
   globalized workplace. Service-learning opportunities can engage students
   cross-culturally while encouraging them to think critically about
   audience awareness. This case extends the literature by reporting on how
   students learned principles of cross-cultural and accessible
   communication. Methods/approach: This study uses qualitative student
   reflection documents from two courses to answer questions about how
   service-learning opportunities shape student skills. Their responses
   illustrate the successes and failures in the course designs and provide
   strategies for instructors working on similar projects.
   Results/discussion: Students reported that their experiences helped them
   to think critically about audience awareness, synthesize skills in
   collaboration, engage flexibly with new technologies, and work through
   time constraints. Conclusion: We provide practical suggestions for
   implementing similar course designs at other institutions and
   information about implementing relevant technologies. It outlines
   adaptations for new teaching environments.},

Abstract = {Background: Preparing students to work on teams in the workplace is both
   important and challenging. The transfer of learning from school to work
   requires that faculty provide guidance to support teamwork processes,
   including team communication. Literature review: Leader communication,
   especially when nondirective, has been associated with team success.
   Nondirective leaders influence others and develop quality relationships
   through personal rather than position power. Personal power is created
   partly through interactions in which a leader's linguistic behavior
   effectively manages rapport with team members. Research questions: We
   wanted to explore the influence of team member feedback on leader
   rapport management, leader-member relationship quality, and perceived
   team effectiveness. Research methodology: We designed a feedback
   intervention that was delivered to team leaders within multidisciplinary
   student teams in a technical writing course. The study was a
   traditional, intervention-based, between-subjects quasi-experiment.
   Results/discussion: Despite its singular focus on team leader behavior,
   the intervention resulted in higher perceived group effectiveness.
   Although leader rapport management and leader-member relationship
   quality were higher in teams with feedback intervention, the effects
   were not statistically significant. Conclusion: We discuss several
   potential causes of our results, including several options for future
   research. Ultimately, because the intervention is simple to create and
   efficient to share, we conclude that it can supply instructors with one
   useful tool for intervening in student teamwork processes to improve
   team outcomes and for emphasizing the importance of interpersonal
   communication and leadership in teams.},

Title = {Better Communication = Better Teams: A Communication Exercise to Improve
   Team Performance},

Abstract = {Background: Teams are a basic way of organizing work in many
   professional and personal settings. However, misunderstandings among
   team members can lead to poor performance, hurt feelings, and lack of
   motivation to attack subsequent tasks. A common source of such
   misunderstandings is miscommunication caused by differences in how
   people interpret everyday words and phrases. Team members might
   interpret these differences as a natural occurrence of group work, if
   they notice them at all. Research questions: We seek to answer two
   research questions regarding miscommunication within teams: (1) Can a
   communication exercise create awareness among team members of the danger
   of miscommunication? (2) What benefits do team members gain from the
   exercise? Situating the case: We describe a classroom exercise that
   relies on an integrative model for improving communication within teams.
   We also present evidence of the exercise's effectiveness in raising
   awareness and fostering accommodation and social learning among team
   members. Our approach is similar to that used in other cases. How this
   case was studied: We used 13 teams from three classes during the course
   of a regular semester. A communication exercise we have used for many
   years was conducted as part of team formation activities early in the
   semester. Team discussions regarding exercise results formed the basis
   for team members to analyze their communication during the semester.
   About the case: A significant variance of understanding among people as
   to the meaning of several of the focal terms can lead to suboptimal
   outcomes for any given work the team is tasked to achieve. In this case,
   we describe a study designed to improve communication among team members
   and, thus, lessen the likelihood of such a negative outcome. Results:
   Team members reported better awareness of communication issues and
   improved team functioning as a result of having completed the exercise.
   Conclusion: We find that a shared understanding of terminology is an
   important part of training leaders and managers to help teams reduce
   common miscommunication problems in the workplace.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Organizations are increasingly investing in virtual
   customer communities that reduce communication barriers between
   organizations and customers. However, little is known regarding how
   virtual customer communities might affect a firm's learning and
   innovation activities. Research question: What effects do virtual
   customer communities have on the relationship between absorptive
   capacity and organizational innovation? Literature review: Research has
   shown that virtual customer communities promote knowledge creation and
   knowledge sharing by facilitating communication within a virtual
   customer community. We investigate the extent to which interactivity in
   virtual customer communities influences the relationship between a
   firm's absorptive capacity (the ability to identify, assimilate, and
   apply external knowledge) and the extent to which a firm develops
   incremental and radical innovations. Methodology: We test this model
   with a quantitative survey-based research design that involves 102
   firm-sponsored virtual customer communities. We use hierarchical
   regression techniques to test our hypotheses. Results: Absorptive
   capacity is positively related to incremental innovation and negatively
   related to radical innovation. Furthermore, virtual customer community
   interactivity moderates the relationship between absorptive capacity and
   incremental innovation. Conclusions: Virtual customer communities are
   transforming communication relationships between organizations and
   customers in ways that influence a firm's learning and innovation
   activities. One limitation of our study is the use of a single
   respondent for our survey. We recommend that future research examine how
   virtual customer communities affect organization-customer communication
   channels.},

Abstract = {Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured
   authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires
   that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to
   teach component content management to students who may initially be
   intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin
   Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how
   component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating
   User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing
   program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and
   professional writing best teach English and humanities students to
   operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational
   abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre
   knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical
   documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was
   informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources,
   which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and
   Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of ``layers of
   abstraction{''} guides the development of the course's structure,
   allowing students to separate and independently process the various
   aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied:
   The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as
   they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and
   structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student
   reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall
   2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals
   and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the
   mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were
   cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing
   concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an
   audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution
   was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or
   open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing
   the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students'
   previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality
   documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3:
   Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking
   Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5:
   Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of
   abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results
   of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions:
   Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen
   many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component
   content management and structured authoring for students who might
   become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid
   overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain
   a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication
   requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and
   their constraints.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Over the past decade, the popularity of fantasy sports
   games has grown dramatically. A fantasy sport is a simulation game in
   which game players act as owners to build, manage, and coach imaginary
   teams that compete against one another, based on statistics generated by
   actual players or teams of a professional sport. In line with this, we
   have seen the emergence of various forms of media content being produced
   directly for those who participate in fantasy sports games-the most
   prolific example of this is writing for fantasy sports. This study aims
   to establish an understanding of how fantasy sport articles are
   currently being constructed by assessing the contributions of
   professional journalists and amateur writers. Research questions: RQ1:
   If the standardization of written discourse genres stems from the
   reciprocity between generic conventions and the responses to situations,
   then what are the differences between the discourse strategy used by
   professional journalists and that by their amateur counterparts in
   fantasy sports writing? RQ2: What are the writers' rhetorical goals and
   the reader-writer relationships they wish to establish through the
   fantasy sports texts? Literature review: This study is rooted in the
   notion of genre, a communicative event through which the writer and
   reader interact to make meanings in a particular context. Communication
   of fantasy sports involves the production of content that provides
   readers with news, analysis, and opinions about-and knowledge of-matters
   that concern the games, thus creating pools of intelligence which other
   fantasy sports players can use, add to, argue against, or ignore. This
   amateur-produced content and resulting knowledge communities formed by
   fantasy sports players have led to a genre development that professional
   communicators should examine because it reflects so much technical
   documentation and instructions have migrated into user-generated spaces.
   ``The move{''} in genre analysis is a meaningful rhetorical unit that is
   related to the communicative purpose of a social activity and that
   contributes to the text's overall strategy within its situational
   context. Moves operate in coherence rather than isolation in a text.
   Methodology: A discourse analysis was conducted on 60 fantasy sports
   texts (30 by professional journalists and 30 by amateur writers)
   randomly selected from a few specific sources in 2012. A custom move
   scheme was devised for analyzing fantasy sports texts in this study. The
   results were analyzed using a chi-square test. Results and discussion:
   Results reveal significant differences between the discourse strategy
   used by professional journalists and that by amateur writers. These
   differences include amateur writers differing to some extent in their
   rhetorical goals from professional journalists as they offer media
   consumers a more balanced spread of information, that professional
   journalists place a substantially lower value on making predictions,
   that amateur writers and professional journalists share similar regard
   in terms of the appropriate amount of casualness to include in their
   writing although amateur writers are more included to build casualness
   in their articles, and that the use of writing techniques to invite
   further connection or engagement from readers is being underutilized by
   both professional and amateur writers. The major implications for the
   professional communicators are the insights into user-generated content,
   an approach in which organizations increasingly rely on for their
   product and service documentation.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of this study is to examine US engineering
   students' intercultural competence and its pedagogical implications.
   Three research questions are addressed:
   What are engineering students' levels of awareness and sensitivity
   toward intercultural communication?
   What are their perceived needs in learning intercultural communication?
   Given these findings, what are some useful approaches and methods to
   teach intercultural communication in the engineering communication
   service class?
   Literature review: The literature review examines current studies on US
   engineering students' intercultural competence and establishes the scope
   of the study: intercultural awareness and sensitivity. The researcher
   consulted literature in intercultural studies, international education,
   and engineering education. Methodology: The researcher conducted a mixed
   method study, using surveys, textual analysis, and interviews.
   Two-hundred seventy-two engineering undergraduates at a Midwestern
   public university participated in the study. Participants were recruited
   from an engineering communication class. Data were collected through
   survey instruments, written responses to cross-cultural dialogs and
   critical incidents, and interviews. Both qualitative and quantitative
   analyses were performed. Results and discussion: Participants exhibited
   vague and passive awareness of intercultural communication, average to
   high intercultural sensitivity (subject to self-assessment and social
   desirability bias), and partial acceptance of intercultural
   communication education. Based on these findings, the researcher
   suggests a cultural-general approach to teaching intercultural
   competence in engineering communication service classes. The study is
   limited to research participants at one institution and two aspects of
   intercultural competence. Future studies can involve diverse research
   participants, address more aspects of intercultural competence, and
   examine the use of cultural-general teaching methods in the classroom.},

Abstract = {Concurrent think-aloud protocol (CTA) is often used in usability test
   settings to gain insight into participants' thoughts during their task
   performances. This study adds to a growing body of research within
   technical communication that addresses the use of think-aloud protocols
   in usability test settings. The eye movements and verbalizations of 10
   participants were recorded as they searched for information on a
   website. The analysis of transcripts and real-time eye movement showed
   that CTA is an accurate data-collection method. The researcher found
   that the majority of user verbalizations in the study included words,
   phrases, and sentences that users read from the screen. Silence and
   verbal fillers that occurred during CTA enabled users to assess and
   process information during their searches. This study demonstrates the
   value technical communicators add to the study of usability test

Abstract = {Results in past studies comparing teaching time and effort in online and
   face-to face (FTF) teaching environments have been inconsistent. This
   research study compares the instructional time and effort it took the
   authors to teach the same course online and FTF in their respective
   universities. The authors hypothesize that it takes more time to teach
   online courses. The results of the two-semester study show that both
   authors spent more time per student, approximately 2040 more, in the
   online courses. In the total time spent per student online compared to
   the total time spent per student FTF the paired-samples t-test showed a
   statistically significant difference (t(3) = 6.163, p = 0.1109). The
   authors speculate a number of factors contributed to this difference and
   the perception that teaching in an online environment takes more time
   and effort than teaching in a FTF environment.},

Title = {Professional communication and a `whole new mind': Engaging with ethics,

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {This paper describes a new cross-curricular design for an engineering
   communication course based on four themes: (1) ethics, accountability,
   and professionalism; (2) intellectual property; (3) design, creativity,
   and invention; and (4) globalization. It is believed that the thematic
   structure creates both dynamic and contemporary contexts for writing and
   research along with enough freedom to pursue individual student
   interests. The result is a higher degree of intrinsic motivation for the
   assignments. The course is a collaborative effort between an English
   department and a school of engineering designed to both improve
   curriculum and provide more assessment data for engineering
   accreditation. Among the criteria from the Accreditation Board for
   Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the ``ability to communicate
   effectively.{''} Along with satisfying this criterion, the course
   discussed in this paper details how to capture data in support of an
   additional four of ABET's criteria known as ``a-k.{''} After
   highlighting these ABET criteria and giving an overview of the structure
   of the course, the paper details each-theme, including their respective
   readings and assignments. This new course was taught for the first time
   in the 2006-2007 academic year, and the paper closes by weighing the
   outcomes and implications of adopting a similar format. The current
   version of the syllabus and reading list for this course are included in
   this paper.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {198-214},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Based on a case study of a global training team, this article focuses on
   an important ability for professional communicators: collaborating with
   translators. The study confirms the value of approaching translation as
   a collaborative recreation rather than mere information transfer and
   suggests the need to integrate translation with localization and to
   develop team rapport. Relevant abilities include understanding cultural
   and professional context, using bicultural vision, and building team
   relationships. Pursuit of these abilities should draw from translation
   studies and intercultural communication literature and be informed by
   diverse rhetorical traditions. Global educational and research
   partnerships are an ideal way,to pursue these goals. Such collaboration
   can improve research methodology and challenge culturally based
   assumptions about translation-related communication roles and
   competencies.},

Abstract = {Despite numerous sex differences found in spatial navigation,
   perception, and verbal abilities, the manner in which these differences
   manifest themselves in terms of online navigation has yet to be
   explored. We propose a unified framework based on evolutionary
   psychology and supported by recent findings,in cognitive neuroscience
   for understanding sex differences in cognition and how they relate to
   online navigation and website preferences. The literature on sex
   differences in navigation, object location, spatial rotation, the
   perception of color, form, and movement, and verbal fluency is reviewed
   within the context of their evolutionary underpinnings. Based on these
   findings, specific website design recommendations are proposed. Results
   of a pilot study examining sex differences in web navigation provide
   evidence that utilizing an evolutionary approach can engender findings
   with significant implications for e-communication researchers and
   practitioners alike.},

Abstract = {Much of the empirical research on the effectiveness of different
   instructional designs has focused on declarative tasks, where a learner
   acquires knowledge about a certain topic. It is unclear to what extent
   findings for learning declarative tasks (which are not consistent on all
   aspects) carry over to learning procedural tasks, where a learner
   acquires a certain skill. In this paper, we describe an experiment
   studying a specific kind of procedural instructions, namely exercises
   for the prevention of repetitive strain injury (RSI), taking information
   modality (text versus picture versus film clip) and difficulty degree of
   the exercises (easy versus difficult) into account. In the experiment,
   participants had to learn RSI exercises and were asked to execute them.
   The results showed that an instruction in a picture lead to the shortest
   learning times followed by an instruction in a film clip. An instruction
   in text led to the longest learning times. For the amount of practicing
   the exercises during the learning phase, it was found that the
   participants in the film clip condition hardly engaged in practicing the
   exercises during the learning phase. The participants in the picture
   condition engaged in a moderate amount of practicing of the exercises
   during the learning phase. The participants in the text condition
   engaged in the most practicing during the learning phase. The results
   concerning the execution times showed that an instruction in a picture
   led to the lowest execution times followed by an instruction in a film
   clip. The instruction in text led to longest execution times. Finally,
   for the amount of correctly executed exercises, it was found that
   learning from a film clip led to the highest learning performance, both
   for easy and for difficult exercises. Learning from an instruction in
   text led to a fairly good learning performance, both for easy and
   difficult exercises. Learning from a picture led to a good learning
   performance for the easy exercises, but the performance dropped for the
   difficult exercises.},

Abstract = {Collaborative tools typically employ linear threading for representing
   and organizing the contributions of the discussants. We argue that
   linear representations provide little support for the conceptualization,
   contextualization, and visualization of the discussion. To address these
   drawbacks, we propose the usage of semantic networks for representing
   discussions. In this paper we demonstrate the applicability of semantic
   network representation to discussions through the development of a
   prototype named Collective Thought. We also test some of the potential
   benefits of semantic network discussion representation with an empirical
   study. More specifically, we compare these two modes of discussion
   representation (i.e., linear versus semantic network) in terms of
   effects on the communication process as measured by perceived
   contextualization and on the communication outcome as measured by mutual
   understanding, using both subjective and objective indicators. The
   results show that semantic network discussion representation leads to a
   higher level of perceived contextualization and better Mutual
   understanding.},

Abstract = {Firms that are trying to stay competitive in the current business
   environment often require the use of groups. The popularity of group
   work is tied to the promise of improved productivity via the pooling of
   information, knowledge, and skills. In recent years, group work has been
   expanded to virtual or distributed environments. However there are
   questions about how aspects of group work-specifically group size and
   social presence-impact group members' ability to voice opinions. This
   study examines groups of two sizes in three distinct social presence
   settings: face-to-face, face-to:face using collaborative software, and
   virtual using collaborative software. This study finds that both group
   size and social presence affect individual instrumental voice,
   value-expressive voice, and the group interaction process. The results
   show that by increasing social presence through the use of collaborative
   software, it is possible to lessen the negative impact of increasing
   group size. These results should be of interest to the increasing number
   of organizations that are implementing virtual group environments.},

Abstract = {This study examines the frequency with which 12 writing tutors used
   hints in their suggestions to 12 engineering students in 13 interactions
   about technical writing. Of the 424 suggestions tutors made, 106 were
   hints. Using Weizman's model as a guide, the study describes three types
   of hints that tutors used: evaluations, general rules, and elisions. It
   also investigates the benefits that tutors receive from using those
   types of hints and examines the problems for students that can arise
   when tutors state their suggestions as hints. Combined with previous
   research findings, the findings of this study Suggest that tutors should
   pair mildly negative evaluations and general rules with direct
   Suggestions, and tutors should avoid strongly negative evaluations, Le.,
   criticisms. The findings also suggest that tutors can elide suggestions
   and provide words and phrases for students' documents but that they
   should only do this occasionally to model effective tone or syntax.},

Abstract = {Previous empirical findings from the computer-mediated communication
   research literature are consistent with media richness theory because
   they suggest that the use of electronic communication media is likely to
   have a negative impact on the success and outcome quality of process
   improvement groups. These findings lead to the expectation that
   electronic communication media will not be as appropriate as the
   face-to:face medium to support the type of complex and knowledge-rich
   communication that takes place in process improvement groups. This paper
   analyzes 12 process improvement groups interacting through an electronic
   communication medium and finds this expectation unfounded. In fact, the
   use of an electronic communication medium can actually have the opposite
   effect, that is, a ``positive{''} effect, on process improvement group
   success and outcome quality. Two other theoretical models, namely the
   compensatory adaptation and social influence models, are used to explain
   these counterintuitive findings.},

Title = {Information Design for Small Screens: Toward Smart Glass Use in Guidance
   for Industrial Maintenance},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {407-426},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Smart glasses and other extended reality (XR) solutions
   provide new ways of utilizing technical documentation with hands-busy
   tasks in the field. Scaling up the use of XR solutions in industry has
   been difficult due to the manual authoring of content for each device
   and task. Therefore, authoring solutions and information design methods
   need to be developed to scale content automatically to different devices
   and applications. Literature review: Related work includes smart glasses
   and industrial maintenance work, categorization based on users' skill
   levels, and standardized guidelines in information design. Research
   questions: 1. How should information content be designed and created to
   support use in smart glasses and other small-screen devices in addition
   to existing delivery channels? 2. How can the same information content
   be utilized to deliver relevant content to users based on their skill
   levels? 3. Are the users of technical instructions ready to accept smart
   glasses and XR as a delivery channel? Methodology: We describe a study
   that focused on designing maintenance instructions for small screens.
   The information was authored in DITA XML format, and a smart glass
   application was used in user tests to evaluate the delivery and
   usability of the information. We used thinking aloud and participant
   observation as well as questionnaires to collect data. Results and
   discussion: The chosen information design methods successfully
   compressed technical information, and automatic filtering of content
   supported different use cases. Participants were enthusiastic about the
   use of smart glasses, and the instructions helped in performing tasks.
   Conclusions: Information designed with the user-centered approach of
   minimalism works best with instructions on small screens, and filtering
   information using DITA XML elements is an efficient way to scale
   information for different user needs.},

Title = {Editing the Pitch: Patterns of Editing Strategies of Written Pitches in
   a Chilean Accelerator Program},

Abstract = {Background: After a six-month training program in the Chilean public
   accelerator Start-Up Chile, entrepreneurs are asked to update a short
   pitch they wrote in the submission stage to appear in the program's
   online portfolio. Literature review: We reviewed relevant literature
   related to the pitch as well as research aiming to track changes within
   pitches. Research questions: 1. Which are the editing strategies used to
   change their pitch? 2. Do these strategies conform to specific
   discursive patterns? Research methodology: To answer the research
   questions, we designed an exploratory qualitative study to describe in
   depth the editing strategies used by two generations of startups,
   corresponding to 148 pairs of written pitches. In order to contextualize
   the results, we conducted two interviews with the program managers and
   analyzed the accelerator's official Playbook and Technical and
   Administrative Requirements. Results: We identified 10 editing
   strategies. Of those editing strategies, ``Deleting technical
   descriptions{''} is by far the most common procedure. The identified
   patterns can be classified into two groups, those simplifying, hedging,
   and focusing on certain elements of the first pitch, and those adding
   and specifying information of the first version. Conclusions: We
   conclude by discussing the strengths of this methodological approach for
   understanding such edits and for supporting successful edits in
   accelerator programs, as well as the potential for better understanding
   entrepreneur coachability.},

Title = {Following the Leader: An Analysis of Leadership and Conformity in
   Business Meetings},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {311-326},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Past research has established the importance of discursive
   leadership in professional communication, but it has not systematically
   examined how conformity behaviors emerge as a potentially undesirable
   consequence of discursive leadership. Literature review: Review of the
   literature on the centrality of communication in leadership processes
   and conformity behavior suggest a void of analytic tools to adequately
   examine the negative consequences of discursive leadership. Research
   question: Are later interlocutors more likely to speak similarly to
   earlier ones if the earlier interlocutors occupy a more central position
   in the conversation network? Methodology: Based on 32,000 words of a
   transcribed meeting corpus, we measured conformity behaviors using Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency scores, which are widely used in
   the information retrieval setting. We also operationalized the strength
   of discursive leadership as a positional centrality measure in the
   conversation network using a matrix algebra approach in social network
   analysis. Results: Findings support the hypothesis that discursive
   leadership is associated with conformity in language aligned toward
   discursive leaders' opinions. Conclusions: This study makes theoretical
   advances in understanding leadership construction and conformity
   behaviors between leaders and followers using empirical, authentic
   meeting data. We also give business people an applied understanding of
   the process of discursive leadership, which may help them to improve
   communication efficacy in their organizations by reducing overly
   conforming behaviors. We recommend that future research include more
   diverse participants and be combined with a survey to supplement the
   conversation data.},

Title = {Hard or Soft Sell? Understanding White Papers as Content Marketing},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-38},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Although some have noted that combining technical and
   marketing content is precarious, technical communication professionals
   are increasingly involved in content marketing, which includes the
   creation of white papers. Literature review: The little existing
   literature on white papers provides conflicting guidance about managing
   the combination of technical and marketing content. Both soft-sell and
   hard-sell marketing approaches have been recommended. One source of such
   inconsistent guidance may be the lack of agreement about definitions.
   Research on print advertisements has described hard and soft selling as
   multidimensional rather than binary aspects of persuasive appeals.
   Research question: Which dimensions of hard- and soft-sell appeals are
   predominant in white papers? Research methodology: To complete our
   descriptive study, we collected a corpus of documents labeled as white
   papers in TechRepublic, and then selected and trained three raters to
   complete a series of judgments about dimensions of persuasive appeals in
   the corpus. We aggregated those ratings, calculating the mean and
   standard deviation for the dimensions to describe their distribution
   across the corpus. Results/discussion: Overall, hard-sell dimensions
   were more prevalent than soft-sell dimensions. However, the soft-sell
   category of ``implicitness{''} was also dominant. Conclusion: Our
   results demonstrate the value of treating hard and soft selling as
   multidimensional, complementary, and combinatory marketing appeals that
   allow, for example, a single white paper to be both ``subjective{''}
   (soft sell), and ``precise{''} (hard sell), or both ``creative{''} (soft
   sell) and ``informative{''} (hard sell).},

Title = {Contradictory Comments: Feedback in Professional Communication Service
   Courses},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2},
Pages = {115-129},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Professional communication instructors give profuse feedback
   on student writing in service or introductory courses; however,
   professional communication has traditionally borrowed feedback practices
   from first-year writing. In addition, professional communication
   instructors have relied on lore instead of data when giving students
   feedback. Literature review: Three recent studies examine the content of
   feedback comments given by professional communication instructors;
   nevertheless, these studies open questions about how professional
   communication instructors enact their pedagogical values when giving
   feedback. Research questions: 1. What do instructors value when teaching
   professional communication service courses? 2. What do instructors
   emphasize in their feedback? 3. To what extent do instructors' values
   align with the feedback that they give on students' writing? Research
   methodology: To answer these questions, this pilot study does close
   qualitative work to test interview questions and a coding scheme formed
   by inductive content analysis. I triangulated four interviews about
   instructors' pedagogical values with content analysis of their 599
   feedback comments on students' writing. Results and discussion: The
   results reveal three implications: Rhetorical terminology may contradict
   the goals of professional communication, overly conversational or
   directive feedback may not give students tools to improve their writing,
   and borrowing pedagogical training from first-year composition may not
   prepare instructors to teach professional communication. Conclusion:
   Tensions between instructors' values and their feedback comments
   highlight a lack of consensus about professional communication's
   pedagogical values for the service course, particularly higher order
   values, such as audience analysis or purpose through giving feedback.},

Title = {Introducing Fireant: A Freeware, Multiplatform Social Media
   Data-Analysis Tool},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {428-442},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a new social media data-analysis tool called
   FireAnt that allows technical and professional communication
   researchers, instructors, and students to easily collect, analyze, and
   visualize social media communication. Problem: Currently, most social
   media analysis is carried out using custom computer scripts written in
   programming languages such as Python and R. Although these custom
   scripts can be very powerful, they create an enormous barrier to those
   without a strong computational background or the resources to hire a
   software engineer or data scientist. Key concepts: FireAnt is a
   freeware, stand-alone, multiplatform social media data-analysis tool
   designed for both novice and expert computer users. It can be used to
   collect, analyze, and subsequently visualize social media data as
   time-series plots, geopositional maps, and network graphs. It can also
   export results for further processing using traditional corpus tools,
   statistical packages, and custom scripts. Key lessons: This paper will
   show how FireAnt can be used to collect social media data related to
   specific companies, analyze those data, and visualize the data in a
   variety of ways. Implications for practice: FireAnt has applications in
   various technical and professional communication settings-for example,
   as part of a strategy to develop a social media presence and in the
   analysis of company-customer interactions and user perceptions of goods
   and services. It can also be used in the technical writing classroom as
   part of instructor- and student-centered instruction on the safe,
   appropriate, and effective use of language on social media platforms.},

Title = {The Effect of Active Learning Strategies on Communication Apprehension

Abstract = {Information-technology (IT) professionals play an important
   organizational role within service-oriented business environments
   through both their technical and their strong communication skills.
   However, developing communication competence as a part of IT higher
   education does not receive enough attention, especially since
   communication apprehension is a key obstacle in terms of achieving
   communication effectiveness. Thus, the research questions in this study
   are as follows: What kinds of activities applied in a classroom setting
   can increase students' communication competence? What are the effects of
   active learning strategies on students' communication apprehension?
   Situating the case: Understanding communication apprehension and its
   relationship with communication competence is necessary for designing
   effective communication courses for management information systems
   students. How the case was studied: This study implemented active
   learning strategies in three classes to develop students' communication
   competence while decreasing their communication apprehension level.
   Surveys were administered to students to evaluate their level of
   communication apprehension. About the case: Adopting psychoeducation
   intervention strategies from occupational therapy, this study
   implemented different active learning strategies to further develop
   students' communication competence as well as decrease their
   communication apprehension. The results show that the levels of
   communication apprehension among these classes decreased significantly
   following adoption of these strategies. Conclusions: Active learning
   strategies adopted in these classes were effective in terms of
   decreasing communication anxiety by increasing students' willingness to
   communicate, which is the prerequisite for developing effective
   communication.},

Abstract = {Research problem: This study investigates the factors influencing
   students' intentions to use emergency notification services to receive
   news about campus emergencies through short-message systems (SMS) and
   social network sites (SNS). Research questions: (1) What are the

   receive emergency notifications? (2) What are the critical factors that
   influence students' intention to use SNS to receive emergency
   notifications? Literature review: By adapting Media Richness theory and
   prior research on emergency notifications, we propose that perceived
   media richness, perceived trust in information, perceived risk,
   perceived benefit, and perceived social influence impact the intention
   to use SMS and SNS to receive emergency notifications. Methodology: We
   conducted a quantitative, survey-based study that tested our model in
   five different scenarios, using logistic regression to test the research
   hypotheses with 574 students of a large research university in the
   northeastern US. Results and discussion: Results suggest that students'
   intention to use SNS is impacted by media richness, perceived benefit,
   and social influence, while students' intention to use SMS is influenced
   by trust and perceived benefit. Implications to emergency managers
   suggest how to more effectively manage and market the service through
   both channels. The results also suggest using SNS as an additional means
   of providing emergency notifications at academic institutions.},

Abstract = {Research problem: Our study focuses on how students collaborate online
   to produce specific written genres, using particular collaborative
   technologies to work together productively, and how instructor feedback
   and student perspectives on collaborative work influence those
   activities in online classrooms. Research questions: When composing
   using collaborative web-based writing applications, do students focus
   primarily on the interface or the text space? What kinds of expectations
   about collaborative writing do students bring to the interface and text
   space? To what extent can we characterize students' acknowledgement of a
   third space, what we have identified as ``communicative interaction?{''}
   Literature review: Workplace collaboration is important because
   organizations increasingly demand effective collaborators, team members,
   and team leaders, and technologies for sharing, cobuilding, and feedback
   are readily available to support these activities. Student preparation
   for workplace collaboration is important because students struggle when
   they are asked to write together, particularly when the collaborative
   process involves new technologies, and yet knowledge of collaborative
   writing strategies and experience with collaborative technologies, such
   as Google Docs, are the very competencies that organizations expect of
   them. Methodology: Thirteen groups of 3 to 4 technical writing students
   and science communication students enrolled in online professional
   writing courses at a major research university wrote feature
   specifications and reports on the globalization of the sciences,
   respectively, using Google Docs within Google Drive. Sixteen of 37
   students responded to a set of questions asking them to reflect on their
   experiences working collaboratively, learning new genres, using the
   collaborative environment, and revising with instructor feedback.
   Results and conclusions: We found that students struggled most with
   adapting their already established collaborative strategies grounded in
   face-to-face learning situations to an online learning environment,
   where they felt their means of communication and expression were
   limited. The results suggest that effective collaborative experiences,
   properly executed, represent a repertoire of competencies that go well
   beyond only technical considerations, such as being able to effectively
   assign roles, set milestones, and navigate the numerous tasks and
   processes of writing as a team. The small number of students and the
   single instructor with her own particular feedback style limit the
   study. Future research includes looking at how different feedback styles
   influence student collaborative writing.},

Abstract = {Research problem: A construct mediated in digital environments,
   information communication technology (ICT) literacy is operationally
   defined as the ability of individuals to participate effectively in
   transactions that invoke illocutionary action. This study investigates
   ICT literacy through a simulation designed to capture that construct, to
   deploy the construct model to measure participant improvement of ICT
   literacy under experimental conditions, and to estimate the potential
   for expanded model development. Research questions: How might a
   multidisciplinary literature review inform a model for ICT literacy? How
   might a simulation be designed that enables sufficient construct
   representation for modeling? How might prepost testing simulation be
   designed to investigate the potential for improved command of ICT
   literacy? How might a regression model account for variance within the
   model by the addition of affective elements to a cognitive model?
   Literature review: Existing conceptualizations of the ICT communication
   environment demonstrate the need for a new communication model that is
   sensitive to short text messaging demands in crisis communication
   settings. As a result of this prefect storm of limits requiring the
   communicator to rely on critical thinking, awareness of context, and
   information integration, we designed a cognitive-affective model
   informed by genre theory to capture the ICT construct: A sociocognitive
   ability that, at its most effective, facilitates illocutionary action-to
   confirm and warn, to advise and ask, and to thank and request-for
   specific audiences of emergency responders. Methodology: A prepost
   design with practitioner subjects allowed investigation of performance
   improvement on tasks demanding illocutionary action after training on
   tasks of high, moderate, and low demand. Through a model based on the
   independent variables character count, wordcount, and decreased time on
   task as related to the dependent variable of an overall episode score,
   we were able to examine the internal construct strength with and without
   the addition of affective independent variables. Results and discussion:
   Of the three prepost models used to study the impact of training,
   participants demonstrated statistically significant improvement on
   episodes of high demand on all cognitive model variables. The addition
   of affective variables, such as attitudes toward text messaging, allowed
   increased model strength on tasks of high and moderate complexity. These
   findings suggest that an empirical basis for the construct of ICT
   literacy is possible and that, under simulation conditions, practitioner
   improvement may be demonstrated. Practically, it appears that it is
   possible to train emergency responders to improve their command of ICT
   literacy so that those most in need of humanitarian response during a
   crisis may receive it. Future research focusing on communication in
   digital environments will undoubtedly extend these finding in terms of
   construct validation and deployment in crisis settings.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, various tasks are being conducted by dispersed teams.
   However, such teams lack a common context, and knowledge gaps exist
   among dispersed team members making collaboration difficult. This paper
   seeks to examine whether and how properties of team context (e.g.,
   familiarity with team members and task) have the potential to moderate
   the effects of structure of team context (e.g., dispersion) on dispersed
   team collaboration. Further, this paper teases out these effects in
   teams with a varying extent of dispersion. Findings offer evidence that
   a unique constraint of distance that dispersed teams face may not be the
   key factor that determines their performance.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the role of reprocessability and symbol sets, two
   of the media capabilities identified in Media Synchronicity Theory, and
   different recipient characteristics on knowledge transfer. An
   experimental study manipulating the two specific channel interface
   characteristics was conducted to test the proposed model. Results
   indicate that symbol sets have a positive effect on knowledge possessed
   and knowledge applied. Motivation to learn significantly affected
   knowledge possessed and knowledge applied, while absorptive capacity was
   found to only influence knowledge possessed. The hypothesized
   relationships between reprocessability and knowledge internalization
   were marginally supported, and future research is suggested to address
   this issue.},

Abstract = {Communication researchers have helped frame understandings about
   disciplinary and professional writing. But often they are outsiders
   looking in. To complement that research, this study focuses on insider
   perspectives of engineers in academic and industrial contexts at diverse
   career stages. Qualitative data are analyzed using phenomenological
   research methods. Findings indicate that participant perspectives fall
   along a rhetorical awareness continuum at points spanning from denial
   and acknowledgment to an accentuation of rhetoric as critical to
   individual and organizational Success. Participant perspectives along
   the continuum also vary in terms of writer and reader roles. writer
   identity, career stage/organizational role. and objectivity.
   Implications for practitioners are discussed.},

Abstract = {Hofstede's cultural dimensions model has been widely used as a basic
   explanatory and predictive model in a variety of business studies,
   including studies addressing information management and electronic
   communication issues. This study aimed at assessing Hofstede's model by
   looking into a key issue for information management and electronic
   communication-information overload. The study compared information
   overload-related data from the US and New Zealand. The sample involved
   108 MBA students who held professional or management positions. Data
   analyses employed comparisons of means and partial least squares
   (PLS)-based structural equation modeling techniques. Information
   overload perceptions in the two countries appear to differ
   significantly. This finding seems to be inconsistent with the relatively
   small differences in cultural dimension scores between the US and New
   Zealand, and with those two countries being placed in the same country
   cluster in Hofstede's model. The results call into question the adequacy
   of Hofstede's model as a basis to explain information management
   phenomena.},

Abstract = {A three-year field study of 17 courses; part of an undergraduate degree
   in Information Systems, compared the process and outcomes of three modes
   of delivery: totally online via asynchronous learning networks,
   traditional face-to face courses, and sections using a mix of
   traditional and online activities. There were no significant differences
   in perceived learning by students associated with mode of delivery.
   Group collaboration and access to professors was perceived to be highest
   in mixed-mode sections, while convenience was rated highest in the
   distance sections. For online courses, there was generally a significant
   relationship between the hypothesized mediators (active participation;
   motivation, collaboration, access to the professor, and convenience) and
   perceived learning. Overall, the results of this study show that
   outcomes of online courses improved when professors structured them to
   support the growth of a learning community, by being available online to
   interact with students, and by using collaborative learning strategies.},

   coordination was achieved through internet-based communication. As
   mechanical and electrical researchers involved in the design project, we
   discuss the information exchanges highlighted by our different
   professional cultures and relate how these exchanges lead us to propose
   some methodology to improve the efficiency of virtual meetings. Moreover
   we show the need for new communication tools, ones dedicated to specific
   tasks that are not currently supported, especially shared concept

Abstract = {Techniques for observing selection and reading behavior in professional
   documents, such as the thinking-aloud and the click-and-read methods,
   may affect the reading process to be observed. Such so-called reactivity
   problems complicate the use of these instruments in. experimental
   research and usability testing, If their influence is unknown, any
   experimental results obtained with these instruments may be caused by
   the testing method. One way to detect reactivity effects is to compare
   different instruments in a series of experimental studies. In this
   initial study, we compared the thinking-aloud method, the click-and-read
   method, a combination of these two methods, and a silent reading
   condition. Subjects read and judged a 53-page policy document in one of
   these conditions. We investigated whether or not different observation
   instruments caused specific differences in information
   selection,judgment, and knowledge, Thinking aloud did not cause any
   differences in the selection of information, Both the thinking-aloud and
   the click-and-read methods affected the judgment task outcome. Thinking
   aloud led to many positive and few negative judgments, whereas silent
   reading led to many negative and few positive judgments. The results for
   the click-and-read method showed a tendency toward the same effect,
   Neither method affected the knowledge test results.},

Title = {360° Video for Research Communication and Dissemination: A Case Study
   and Guidelines},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},

Pages = {59-77},

Abstract = {Introduction: 360 degrees videos are increasingly popular channels for
   science communication and higher education; however, time-limited 360
   degrees videos that disseminate scientific research via platforms like
   YouTube remain underexamined. To address this problem, this experience
   report reviews the creation and evaluation of six 2D video interviews
   and six 360 degrees video tours. About the case: The European
   Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) and other public-facing
   organizations already publish 2D videos on social media channels and
   host 360 degrees video content on their institutional websites. This
   case addresses the affordances and constraints of creating short 360
   degrees videos for publication on public-facing platforms. Situating the
   case: 360 degrees video content has been incorporated into science
   communication and pedagogical practices in higher education. The authors
   review these developments and show the need for further research on
   time-limited 360 degrees video. Methods/approach: Scientists researching
   energy-related technologies were invited to record 2D video interviews.
   Based on these interviews, six transcripts for 360 degrees videos were
   drafted and recorded in the same lab settings. When the videos were
   published, European researchers and communication professionals were
   recruited to complete a short survey evaluating the videos' relative
   merits. Results/discussion: The survey results (n = 32) suggest a
   similar overall quality of the 2D video interviews and 360 degrees video
   tours. Respondents ranked the interviewee or narrator as the best
   feature of both the 2D and 360 degrees format, and 47\% said that they
   would prefer to have a 360 degrees video created about their research.
   Based on our experience, we provide guidelines related to the production
   and publication of short 360 degrees videos. Conclusion: Further
   research and practice are required to understand which specific features
   of the 360 degrees videos are most effective and whether this technology
   offers distinct advantages as a tool for dissemination. Further research
   and practice will establish more detailed approaches to 360 degrees
   video.},

Abstract = {Background: Online user networks are important points of contact for
   users who seek help from their peers rather than documentation.
   Literature review: The appeal of online user networks coincides with and
   seems connected to growing user interest in topicalized and tailored
   content, the production of which is inconsistent with the
   ``craftsman{''} model of technical communication. Studies of online user
   networks indicate that community members may be practicing a different
   kind of technical communication. Research questions: This study examines
   an online user network for an open-source software product and asks how
   we can study online user networks, with the aim of identifying important
   people, practices, and relationships associated with the kind of
   technical communication practiced in those settings. Research
   methodology: Social network analysis is used to visualize the structural
   properties of an online user network, in order to identify central
   figures and their relationships to others. Verbal data-analysis
   techniques are used to find themes in their contributions.
   Results/discussion: People who are central to the structure of online
   interaction are important figures in the distribution of the technical
   communication effort. They engage users in reciprocal exchanges of
   information and they influence user practices. They are also important
   as brokers who link users and developers. Broadly, their conversational
   exchanges are a kind of distributed technical communication.
   Implications for practice: We learn what the practice of technical
   communication looks like in an online user network. By observing the
   work of participants, technical communicators can understand what it
   means to do technical communication and make user networks a more
   integral part of a broader documentation strategy. We see promising ways
   in which technical experts (e.g., software developers) can engage with
   users as well.},

Abstract = {Despite the migration of letters and memoranda to electronic media,
   these documents are still occasionally written as hard copy and
   transmitted through the post, especially during risk situations. In two
   recent environmental situations, such letters were sent in 2014 to
   residents in Newark, NJ, who were affected by the discovery of high
   levels of lead in their school water and in 2016 to residents of East
   Chicago, IN, who were affected by the discovery of lead under their
   homes. In each of these situations, letters were sent to residents whose
   reactions ranged from fear in Newark to anger in East Chicago. In
   neither case did residents act as requested. However, in 2011, residents
   in Morgan City, MO, whose land would be flooded by the opening of the
   Morganza Spillway, followed the instructions they received and
   evacuated. Research questions: This study examines the failure of
   citizens and community institutions to respond positively, if at all, to
   requests transmitted in hard copy that are related to risk situations.
   It poses the following research questions: 1. Do commonalities exist
   among the rhetorical decisions made by the writers of letters to which
   readers responded positively in a risk situation? 2. If so, do these
   decisions differ from those made by writers of letters to which readers
   objected or disregarded the requests made? Literature review: Research
   related to rhetorical analyses of primary documents transmitted in hard
   copy between engineers and managers prior to and during risk situations
   was surveyed. In addition, the literature related to rhetorical analyses
   of primary messages transmitted electronically prior to and during risk
   situations was also examined. Methods: A rhetorical analysis of the
   letters focused on the writers' efforts to consider readers' reading
   patterns and styles, prior knowledge, need for background information
   and details, and the economic, political, and psychological context in
   which readers read the letters. Results: The results indicate that the
   Newark and East Chicago letters are writer rather than reader-based, the
   writers failing to consider the readers' reading patterns and styles, to
   provide necessary information, and to recognize the context in which the
   readers read the letters. On the other hand, the letters related to the
   Morganza Spillway are reader-based, providing the necessary information
   at the beginning of the correspondence, as well as providing sufficient
   details to enable readers to take the actions required to safeguard
   themselves and their families, businesses, and homes.},

Title = {Quantification of Engineering Disciplinary Discourse in Resumes: A Novel
   Genre Analysis With Teaching Implications},

Abstract = {Background: Undergraduate engineering students often receive
   insufficient support when crafting resumes. Most notably, there is often
   a lack of disciplinary-specific instruction and a lack of emphasis on
   the persuasive function of resumes. Ultimately seeking to strengthen
   instructional materials, this study investigates a way to quantify the
   quality of engineering resumes, focusing specifically on the use of
   disciplinary discourse. Research questions: How do engineering resumes
   exhibit disciplinary discourse? How can disciplinary discourse be
   quantified as a way of promoting strong engineering resume writing and
   professional development skills? Literature review: This project builds
   on research exploring the qualities of effective resumes. It extends on
   work establishing disciplinary differences in desired resume qualities,
   as well as work characterizing resume writing as an opportunity for
   professional identity development. Grounded in activity theory, this
   project seeks to elucidate the ``rules{''} of effective engineering
   resumes at the lexical level. Methodology: This project analyzed a
   corpus of 31 engineering resumes through both qualitative and
   quantitative means. Resumes were initially ranked via a rubric, then
   coded for disciplinary discourse according to the American Association
   of Engineering Societies' Engineering Competency Model. Disciplinary
   discourse scores were then analyzed through descriptive statistics.
   Results and conclusion: Significant differences in the use of
   disciplinary discourse were found among strong, moderate, and weak
   resumes. Though these results are not generalizable due to the small
   corpus size, they indicate that disciplinary discourse may be a fruitful
   area for future research on resumes and the development of pedagogical
   materials.},

Abstract = {This study aims to delineate the rhetorical organization of research
   article (RA) discussion sections in an engineering discipline and
   explore the variations that distinguish discussion sections of
   high-impact and low-impact RAs. Research questions: What is the
   rhetorical organization of RA discussions in chemical engineering? What
   are the similarities and differences in the use of rhetorical moves and
   steps in RA discussions of high-impact and low-impact articles?
   Literature review: Some studies have been conducted using Swales' move
   analysis with regard to the identification and textual comparisons of RA
   discussion sections. However, it remains to be determined whether RA
   discussions of the high-and low-impact articles within a single
   discipline display the variation in rhetorical patterns. Research
   methodology: A total of 40 RA discussions published between 2005 and
   2015 were chosen based on five-year journal impact factor and citations
   of the articles in which they were published. Swales' move analysis was
   used to compare rhetorical moves and steps in both sets of RA
   discussions. Results and discussion: The study identified the rhetorical
   organization of RA discussions in the field of chemical engineering. The
   findings indicate that discussion sections of high-impact articles tend
   to make use of the ``comment on results{''} move. Explanations of the
   similarities and differences in the employment of moves and steps are
   provided. Implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and
   communication through active involvement of patients, their families,
   physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart
   telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as
   wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS)
   facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles.
   Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve
   the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the
   technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate
   understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study
   addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by
   identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and
   contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators
   and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize
   a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account
   unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the
   literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption
   theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We
   discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development
   but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption.
   Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview
   and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home
   healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we
   collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical
   professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our
   online-and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140
   respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We
   identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption,
   including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality
   expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs
   from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the
   qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The
   quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has
   substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the
   variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that
   human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the
   strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.},

Title = {Longitudinal Effects of Computer-Mediated Communication Anxiety on

Abstract = {Research problem: Organizations continue to rely upon virtual teams, yet
   knowing how, and for how long, individual members' computer-mediated
   communication (CMC) anxiety affects virtual team interactions and
   performance outcomes is not well-known. Research questions: (1) What is
   the relationship between CMC anxiety and virtual team participation? (2)
   How does this relationship influence the perceptions of individual
   performance? (3) Does this relationship persist over time? Literature
   review: A literature review including communication and media
   structures, input-mediator-output team effectiveness, and individual CMC
   anxiety elements indicate researchable negative effects upon virtual
   team interaction and participation in CMC environments. Higher levels of
   individual CMC anxiety could dampen participation quantity,
   participation type (task versus social), participation quality, and
   perceptions of individual performance. Further, the initial negative
   interactions and behaviors could persist over time. Methodology: This
   quantitative quasiexperimental study involved surveying, observing, and
   coding the interactions of 22 virtual project teams (consisting of a
   total of 110 individuals) over a span of four months. The teams used a
   CMC tool with shared file space and discussion boards to coordinate
   database design and implementation work. Data were collected from
   questionnaire surveys, individual message postings, and team project
   scores. Individual message postings were coded to measure participation
   quality (task focus and topic introductions) and participation quantity
   (message count and words per message). Data were analyzed using
   repeated-measures multivariate analyses along with follow-up univariate
   statistical testing. Results and conclusions: The results indicate that
   individuals with higher levels of CMC anxiety participated less, sent
   fewer task-oriented messages, introduced fewer novel topics, and were
   rated more poorly by team members on their performance compared to
   individuals with lower levels of CMC anxiety. The results also show that
   CMC-anxious individuals do send relatively more social-oriented
   messages, perhaps to compensate for typical apprehensive communication
   behaviors in a virtual team environment. In addition, participation
   quality and quantity and perceptions of performance by CMC-anxious team
   members do not significantly improve, even with repeated interactions
   over CMC. Although study participants evidenced high engagement with the
   project tasks, the study is limited by its use of student subjects. The
   study suggests the importance of team leaders and role definitions for
   virtual teams, to counteract potential unintended effects of CMC
   technology use masking actual participation and contribution of virtual
   team members. Future research could investigate the efficacy of
   interventions for reducing the negative impacts of CMC anxiety in
   virtual team performance, as well as the influence of individual
   structures such as CMC anxiety in the use of CMC and team structures in
   the virtual team environment.},

Abstract = {The project management of virtual teams differs from that of traditional
   ones. Traditional project risks, such as complexity, the uncertainty of
   factors influencing the project, and the high interdependency of project
   tasks must be managed alongside changed temporal, geographic, and
   cultural dimensions. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of
   critical technological issues, such as wrong tool selection or limited
   internet access on performance as well as team and team member
   satisfaction in virtual work settings. Research questions: How do
   critical technology-related issues concerning the selection and use of
   web-based tools influence the performance and satisfaction of virtual
   project teams? Literature review: Instead of categorizing virtual teams
   as a type of team that contrasts with traditional or face-to-face teams,
   the focus has shifted to virtualness as a characteristic present in all
   teams. Project teamwork is often integrated in university degree
   programs in order to prepare students appropriately for real-life
   projects. While these student teams are often not geographically spread
   across countries, they have a high degree of virtualness because of
   their diverse team composition, the necessity for working at different
   places, and the limited face-to-face meeting opportunities. Performance,
   effectiveness, and satisfaction are central issues in the evaluation and
   measurement of project teams: Team performance is often evaluated on the
   basis of acceptance of a specified output by a customer. Through
   specific mediating processes, team performance can alternatively be
   assessed by inquiring the team's perception on their performance.
   Effectiveness can be defined as the achievement of clear goals and
   objectives and it is often related to the team's performance. Finally,
   satisfaction can be defined as having three dimensions-satisfaction with
   the team, the satisfaction of meeting customer needs, and general
   satisfaction with extrinsic rewards and work. Technology use is
   substantial for distributed teamwork and can be assessed by the extent
   to which it supports communication, collaboration, and
   project-management tasks. Methodology: Fifteen teams were observed and
   interviewed over a two-year period. The resulting data were analyzed
   using a Grounded Theory approach, which revealed how the selection and
   use of tools for communication, collaboration, and project management in
   the different project activities influenced the team's performance.
   Results and conclusions: Our results contribute to practice by providing
   a number of guidelines for the management of virtual teams as well as
   knowledge required by companies wishing to launch projects with virtual
   teams. Differing performances of teams can, in many cases, be attributed
   to such conditions as: internet availability and bandwidth; lack of
   training for certain tools; the selection and appropriate use of tools;
   integrated tool support for task management; as well as the promotion of
   transparency about progress made. It was found that restrictions in
   internet access of even a single member within a team limited the team's
   technological choices, which affected the team's performance.},

Abstract = {Research problem: The purpose of the study is to understand how
   affective reactions to color impact learning attitudes and outcomes in a
   computer-mediated learning environment. Research question: How do color
   differences change affective processes and outcomes in computer-mediated
   communication? Literature review: Several previous studies exploring
   particular characteristics and learning in computer-mediated
   environments influenced the review of the literature. The literature on
   color psychology indicates that color preferences and affective
   reactions to color can influence behaviors and attitudes. The literature
   on goal achievement motivation posits that affective dispositions
   influence goal orientation, motivation, and individual outcomes. The
   literature on affect infers that affective reactions are responses to
   events, and these reactions influence attitudes and behaviors. The
   current study draws on these prior studies to examine affective reaction
   to color and learning outcomes in a computer-mediated learning
   environment. Methodology: We conducted a quasiexperimental study with 79
   participants, who listened to a visual presentation lecture with either
   blue or yellow background and then completed a survey on their affective
   reactions, learning attitudes, and outcomes. Results and discussion: The
   results of our study indicate that color is not neutral and may
   influence learning attitudes and outcomes and, hence, the color of
   computer technology interface design can influence learning outcomes.
   Practitioners and academics must take people's affective reactions to
   color into account in designs and studies of visual information
   presentations. The sample size and the focus on two color hues (yellow
   and blue) may have some limitations on the conclusions and
   generalizability of this study. Future studies should examine more color
   hues and color saturation to further our understanding of affective
   reactions to colors and consequent impact on attitudes and behavioral
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Problem: One of the biggest problems with student and novice writing is
   that it often lacks clear organization and a coherent structure.
   However, it is difficult for newer writers to conceptualize a clear
   structure prior to writing a first draft. Thus, there is a need for an
   effective process to help writers revise early drafts with a particular
   focus on organizational clarity. Key concepts: Two concepts underlie
   this issue. The first is revision, which is the process of changing text
   to better achieve the writer's goals and serve the reader's needs. Two
   general categories of revision exist: a comprehensive edit (a thorough
   review of content, organization, visual design, style, illustrations,
   accessibility, and reuse to best serve readers) and a copyedit (a review
   of proper adherence to accepted language standards, which includes
   attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure).
   The second is organizational structure (the arrangement and relationship
   of ideas), which is critical to help readers understand and use the
   information in the document. Key lessons: A reverse outline-a process
   that helps improve document structure and organization from an early
   draft-was developed to help writers make the organizational structure of
   an existing document to assess and improve the structure in a subsequent
   revision explicit. Reverse outlining has four steps: (1) identifying and
   listing discourse topics from a written draft, (2) arranging the
   discourse topics into an outline, (3) assessing the structure for
   appropriateness to audience and purpose, and (4) creating the new
   structure, modifying content where necessary, and adding headings,
   bullets, overview statements, and other advanced organizers. The reverse
   outlining process has been used extensively in the classroom and in the
   workplace.},

Abstract = {Individual and work characteristics are used in telecommuting plans;
   however, their impact on telecommuting success is not well known. We
   studied how employee tenure, work experience, communication skills, task
   interdependence, work output measurability, and task variety impact
   telecommuter productivity, performance, and satisfaction after taking
   into account the impact of communication technologies. Data collected
   from 89 North American telecommuters suggest that in addition to the
   richness of the media, work experience, communication skills, and task
   interdependence impact telecommuting success. These characteristics are
   practically identifiable and measurable; therefore, we expect our
   findings to help managers convert increasing telecommuting adoption
   rates to well-defined and measurable gains.},

Abstract = {This study empirically examines the general propositions of media
   capacity theories using a newer and increasingly popular communication
   medium: instant messaging (IM). We develop hypotheses based on the
   proposition that synchronous communication media are perceived to be
   more effective for convergence communication while asynchronous
   communication media are perceived to be more suitable for conveyance
   communication. These hypotheses were tested using data collected from 81
   IM users in four organizations by means of survey instruments developed
   for this study. The results suggest that although IM was perceived to be
   a highly synchronous communication medium. it was not perceived to be as
   effective for convergence communication as it was,for conveyance
   communication. These results seem to challenge the general propositions
   of media capacity theories. Theoretical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {As is true for engineering communication programs nationwide, at MIT
   curricular and pedagogical reforms have been driven by changes in the
   kinds of problems that engineers solve and the associated skill sets
   that engineers must now have in communication and teamwork. This article
   presents three case studies from communication-intensive classes at MIT
   that intend to help students develop the advanced communication skills
   required of professional engineers today. Highlighting classes in
   biological engineering, aeronautics/astronautics engineering, and
   biomedical engineering, we explore the following questions: What does it
   mean for educational practice if professional communication competencies
   and tasks are the goals? How can students and technical faculty best
   create the conditions for students to learn to be skilled team members?
   How can engineering students move from mere display of data to making
   skilled visual arguments based on those data? The importance of helping
   students meet the target competencies of professional practice, of
   teaching effective teamwork and collaboration, and of teaching students
   to understand and argue with visual data are recognized as widespread
   needs, and these case Studies attest to the possibilities and challenges
   in meeting those needs.},

Abstract = {Twenty years after the publication of Patricia Sullivan's ``Beyond a
   narrow conception of usability testing{''} in the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON
   PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION, three scholars-ail Sullivan's
   students-reflect on the history and development of usability testing and
   research. Following Sullivan, this article argues that usability bridges
   the divide between science and rhetoric and asserts that usability is
   most effective when it respects the knowledge-making practices of a
   variety of disciplines. By interrogating trends in usability method, the
   authors argue for a definition of usability that relies on multiple
   epistemologies to triangulate knowledge-making. The article opens with a
   brief history of the development of usability methods and argues that
   usability requires a balance between empirical observation and rhetoric.
   Usability interprets human action and is enriched by articulating
   context and accepting contingency. Usability relies on effective
   collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders in the design of
   technology. Ultimately, professional and technical communication
   scholars are best prepared to coin new knowledge with along and wide
   view of usability.},

Abstract = {Technology mediated learning (TML) is gaining interest from both
   academic researchers and. communication professionals as training with
   internet technology and web-based distance learning become increasingly
   popular. This paper investigates social norms, individual-level cultural
   orientation (collectivism), and affective commitment (internalization
   and identification) and studies their influences on the system users'
   (or learners) attitude toward sharing knowledge by email in the TML
   environment. An empirical test of the proposed model was conducted in
   the pilot test (n = 155) and the main test (n = 411). Theoretical and
   practical implications of these findings for TML, knowledge management,

   and texts that can affect international intellectual property rights.
   Four areas of concern for technical communicators include: (1) US and
   international rules about the disclosure of ideas and inventions; (2)
   corporate policies about confidentiality; (3) the complexities of
   international enforcement of intellectual property; and (4) principles
   of keeping records, including laboratory notebooks, that show ownership
   (including ownership of business methods). The training approach
   stresses a multipart program that includes understanding the patenting
   process, understanding and supporting corporate policies; and
   participating in dialogue about situations involving dissemination of
   information. This training should prepare technical communicators to
   evaluate or to recognize when to seek help from counsel in evaluating
   whether information should be disseminated.},

Abstract = {This study extends the theory of Recognition Primed Decision-Making by
   applying it to groups. Art experiment was conducted in which teams made
   resource allocation decisions while physically dispersed and Supported
   with a shared Virtual work surface (What You See Is What I See-WYSIWIS).
   The task required teams to recognize patterns and collaborate to
   allocate their resources appropriately. The experiment explored the use
   of tools (item versus chunk level communication) designed to minimize
   the cognitive effort required. to recognize and communicate patterns
   among team members. Dependent measures included pattern communication
   correctness, pattern communication time, resource allocation time, and
   outcome quality. All teams received significant financial rewards in.
   direct proportion to their Outcome quality. Teams supported with the
   pattern-communicating tools had significantly higher Outcome quality and
   significantly less resource movements and allocation time than. teams in
   the control condition. Further the teams that used the
   chunk-communicating toot performed signifcantly better than the teams
   Supported with an item-communicating tool.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the design of procedural instructions, technical
   writers need to know how users proceed when they are using them, from
   their initial reading, to execute described actions. Several kinds of
   activities are implicated, such as reading with understanding, action
   planning, carrying out specific actions, and executive control
   activities. This paper proposes that, by taking into account design
   factors that affect these activities, technical writers can markedly
   improve the design of procedural documents. Thus, a model is suggested
   that combines information on how users deal with procedural documents
   when faced with new equipment and the mental processes involved in this
   interaction, together with document design recommendations aimed at
   enhancing the interactions between users, documents, and equipment.},

Abstract = {The cost effectiveness of internet-based communications in the ever more
   fully networked business environment continues to drive the use of web
   surveys for corporate information gathering. However simply applying
   traditional survey techniques to the web can result in significant
   shortcomings in the data so gathered. Recent research has been directed
   at these issues, within the context of web surveys as a general research
   tool. We discuss the application of that research to the narrower
   organizational context. This article synthesizes from the literature on
   web-based surveying and from the authors' own experiences. It suggests a
   design framework for managers and communications professionals
   interested in increasing the statistical validity of web surveys
   deployed in an organizational context. The results of a recent
   organizational web survey developed and administered within the
   framework guidelines support the efficacy of the framework.},

Abstract = {This paper compares the Finnish and English websites of a Finnish
   company to find out what culturally geared strategies emerge and what
   constitutes the genre of company information on the Internet. Drawing on
   genre theory and cultural studies, the paper further explores the
   relationship between linear texts and nonlinear hypertext genre. The
   paper shows how the websites aimed at the English-speaking readers are
   different from the sites targeted to the Finnish readers. It further
   illustrates the company strategies employed to establish the website in
   Finnish and English. These are endorsed by a company representative who
   was interviewed for the paper. The Finnish website meant for local
   Finnish readers contained detailed and itemized information and
   portrayed a retail-oriented strategy. The Internet presence targeted
   toward English-speaking readers portrayed an investor-oriented strategy.
   The characteristics of hypertext that distinguish it from linear texts
   are high rate of repetition. and low macrolevel cohesion.},

Abstract = {Formulating design guidelines from research results can potentially
   offer two advantages: available empirical knowledge is distilled into a
   readily accessible form, and practitioners can judge the authority of
   those guidelines for themselves. But a case history demonstrates that
   challenges confront the der eloper of research-based guidelines for
   website design. First, few studies of people using the Web have yet been
   conducted. Second, when the process of guideline development is not
   systematic and designed to control bias and subjectivity, the resulting
   guidelines can be compromised. This paper describes the issues and
   problems one guideline developer encountered and suggests a guideline
   development process that might resolve them.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation on the
   role of cultural protocol in media choice in a Confucian virtual
   workplace, like those found in Far-East-Asian countries, such as Korea
   and Japan, which are heavily influenced by the Confucius tradition of
   emphasizing respect for the social order in all forms of social
   communication. A Confucian virtual workplace in Korea is studied
   regarding the role of cultural protocol In the use of email. The survey
   results show thar use of emall is significantly influenced by cultural
   protocol, such as showing respect for seniors, within a Confucian
   virtual workplace. When, a worker is faced with media choices for
   communication in a workplace where showing respect is considered
   essential, media richness of the chosen media is found to be less
   important than the capability of providing features to convey cultural
   protocol.},

   Design for Social Justice},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-33},

Abstract = {Background: Technical and professional communication (TPC) audiences are
   increasingly international and intercultural. Some of these audiences,
   such as US asylum applicants, may be vulnerable and suffering trauma
   following violations of their human rights and dignity. Literature
   review: TPC has the potential to either intensify the oppression
   previously experienced by these audiences or empower them to act for
   their own well-being. Therefore, technical and professional instructors
   and practitioners have an ethical responsibility to communicate with
   these audiences through methods that are socially just. Research
   questions: 1. Are the language and design strategies in the I-589
   application and instructions appropriate for their audience from an HCD
   perspective? 2. If not, how can the documents be revised to correct any
   failings in the pursuit of social justice? Research methodology: This
   article uses adapted plain language guidelines combined with
   human-centered design guiding principles to perform a qualitative
   document analysis and explore revisions of the application and
   instructions. Results: Analysis shows that the I-589 documents are not
   appropriate for their audience and proposes revisions to correct major
   issues. Conclusions: The findings of this analysis demonstrate a need
   for continued integration of plain language and human-centered design in
   practice and pedagogy, research surrounding the ways in which technical
   and professional communicators should balance the needs of vulnerable
   audiences with the interests of powerful stakeholders, and meaningful
   collaboration between them and government institutions.},

Abstract = {Research questions: 1. How can we address issues of diversity, equity,
   and inclusion (DEI) in our business and technical communication service
   courses? 2. How can we help prepare future engineers, technical
   professionals, and managers to create more inclusive and equitable
   workplaces?. Situating the case: The social justice literature in
   technical and professional communication (TPC) has focused on a variety
   of areas, including research methods, user experience, and expanding
   what can and should be identified as TPC. Emerging research has turned
   toward pedagogy as an interventional strategy for educating on issues of
   racial justice and inclusion. About the case: This teaching case
   presents the transformation of a TPC service course to specifically
   address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In response to
   the racial injustice documented during the summer of 2020, I developed a
   sequence of assignments that asked students to research and apply DEI
   initiatives. The assignment was to research and write a short report on
   DEI approaches in the workplace, followed by a larger team-based project
   in which students worked with the local city council to enact possible
   DEI initiatives in the broader community. Methods: The case was studied
   through the author's experience and the analysis of data obtained from
   surveys with class participants and other instructors who incorporated
   the assignments in their courses. Results/discussion: Students were able
   to learn more about how to address bias, inclusion, and social justice
   in a business environment, but also demonstrated some implicit
   resistance to direct attention to racial injustice. The case study
   humanizes and brings home issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion for
   students who might otherwise consider them only in the abstract.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Data visualization is a reliable tool for professional
   communication practitioners to synthesize and present data for a variety
   of audiences. However, data visualizations have a range of accessibility
   concerns, including visual acuity, color/contrast difficulties, color
   blindness, and size/scale issues. Data visualizations should therefore
   be designed following web standards for complex images to ensure that
   they are accessible to audiences with diverse needs. Key lessons: Follow
   these best practices to create visually accessible data visualizations.
   1. Design the visual for accessibility by using whitespace, creating
   contrast, maintaining size/scale, and labeling the visual clearly. 2.
   Implement the visual using web standards to create semantic connections
   between the visual and text for both users and accessibility
   technologies. This goal can be achieved with textual description,
   overview/data/presentation context, or ARIA semantic links. 3. Test the
   visual for accessibility through user tests and industry-standard tools.
   Implications for practice: Web standards provide a blueprint for
   designing accessible data visualizations for online spaces, but
   professional communicators should be aware of the coding expertise and
   necessary infrastructure needed to deploy these visuals. Nevertheless,
   with increasing use of public-facing data visualizations to convey
   information on global issues, such as COVID-19, the need for these
   visuals to be accessible to all audiences becomes paramount.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {170-184},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Communication is fundamental to the success of engineered
   systems, enabling interactions between the system's stakeholders.
   Systems engineering, an integrative discipline on which the
   contributions of many disciplines are evaluated against each other, may
   particularly benefit from research in communication methods.
   Specifically, storytelling may be beneficial to engineers because it
   enables sense-making. Research into storytelling is conducted to
   identify storytelling metrics that could be useful in engineering
   communication, specifically engineering case studies. Literature review:
   Although storytelling has been identified in past research as possibly
   useful to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and software
   requirement writing, a rigorous study of the use of storytelling
   elements in systems engineering communication has not been performed.
   Research question: How are storytelling elements currently being applied
   in engineering case studies? Research methodology: Twelve
   interdisciplinary metrics from storytelling, content analysis, and
   engineering are identified from the literature and used to characterize
   a collection of 48 NASA case studies. The values of the metrics for each
   case study are determined and analyzed using statistical and content
   analyses. Results and discussion: Analysis of the 12 metrics indicates
   that the case study design region with a historical backstory structure,
   climactic plot structure, and early points of attack is most frequently
   used by designers. Conclusions: The analysis indicates that certain
   storytelling elements applied in engineering case studies are used more
   frequently. Further work is needed to leverage the metrics as design
   variables in engineering case study writing.},

   reviewed the literature related to the convergence and divergence of
   corporate behaviors under the framework of the institutional theory.
   Comparative studies on web-based CSR communication (CSRC) were also
   addressed, and CSR development in China and Korea was described as the
   research context to develop hypotheses and research questions. Research
   questions: 1. How do Chinese and Korean CSRCs resemble each other in
   international social media? 2. What are the differences between Chinese
   and Korean CSRCs in international social media? Research methodology: I
   selected six Chinese companies and six Korean firms from the 2019 Forbes
   2000 world's-largest-corporations ranking, and analyzed the content of
   their English-language Facebook accounts using ``Leximancer,{''} a
   powerful textual analysis software package. Results: Results indicated
   that the CSR messages of Chinese and Korean firms resembled each other
   at a macrolevel but differed at a microlevel. In addition, the CSR
   messages of Chinese companies were more likely to reflect national
   strategic agendas, while Korean firms placed greater emphasis on
   short-term events and legal compliance. Conclusions: Chinese and Korean
   corporations have adopted an approach of ``global topics, native
   framing{''} in their CSRCs to achieve a balance between internal and
   external legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Background: Visualizations are used to communicate data about important
   political, social, environmental, and health topics to a wide range of
   audiences; however, perceptions of graphs as objective conduits of
   factual data make them an easy means for spreading misinformation.
   Research questions: 1. Are people deceived by common deceptive tactics
   or exaggerated titles used in data visualizations about
   non-controversial topics? 2. Does a person's previous data visualization
   coursework mitigate the extent to which they are deceived by deceptive
   tactics used in data visualizations? 3. What parts of data
   visualizations (title, shape, data labels) do people use to answer
   questions about the information being presented in data visualizations?
   Literature review: Although scholarship from psychology, human-computer
   interaction, and computer science has examined how data visualizations
   are processed by readers, scholars have not adequately researched how
   susceptible people are to a range of deceptive tactics used in data
   visualizations, especially when paired with textual content.
   Methodology: Participants (n = 329) were randomly assigned to view one
   of four treatments for four different graph types (bar, line, pie, and
   bubble) and then asked to answer a question about each graph.
   Participants were asked to rank the ease with which they read each graph
   and comment on what they used to respond to the question about each
   graph. Results/Discussion: Results show that deceptive tactics caused
   participants to misinterpret information in the deceptive versus control
   visualizations across all graph types. Neither graph titles nor previous
   coursework impacted responses for any of the graphs. Qualitative
   responses illuminate people's perceptions of graph readability and what
   information they use to read different types of graphs. Conclusions:
   Recommendations are made to improve data visualization instruction,
   including critically examining software defaults and the ease with which
   people give agency over to software when preparing data visualizations.
   Avenues of future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Professional communication instructors in transnational
   contexts face unique challenges when helping students transition into
   the workplace. These challenges include preparing students for
   multilingual workplaces and educational settings, as well as
   multicultural communication in English at transnational workplaces.
   About the case: The authors, working at an international branch campus
   (IBC) in the Middle East, wanted to revise their assignments in a
   technical writing course for engineers in order to better prepare
   students for the realities of professional communication in the region.
   Situating the case: Engineering students matriculate into an
   increasingly diverse workplace, but instructors may not adequately
   understand the needs of employers in transnational corporations.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with students and
   alumni of the IBC, and transcripts were coded for common themes.
   Results/discussion: Students and alumni had different perceptions of
   workplace communication genres, expectations for detailed writing, and
   the ability to adapt rhetorical strategies for different contexts.
   Alumni experienced a gap between their professors' and their workplaces'
   expectations for business genres and level of detail. They also reported
   that one of their significant challenges was adopting a flexible mindset
   toward written and spoken communication practices. Conclusions:
   Professional communication instructors should emphasize the strengths of
   multilingual writers, particularly their sense of language difference
   and rhetorical attunement, to better prepare them for the transnational
   workplace, in both the US and abroad. The authors describe changes in
   their pedagogy to help students adopt a more flexible and
   industry-oriented mindset toward technical communication.},

Abstract = {Research problem: In contemporary knowledge-intensive spaces, workers
   often team with experts from different disciplinary backgrounds and
   different geographic locations and, thus, they face the challenge of
   integrating knowledge in their work. When modeling how communication can
   be improved in these circumstances, previous studies have often relied
   on social network analysis to understand the aggregate exchanges among
   team members. In this study, rather than analyze social networks (people
   linked by communication), we argue that network analysis of knowledge
   networks (people linked by common knowledge) presents an opportunity to
   better understand and address the challenge of knowledge integration in
   organizational contexts. Research questions: 1. How can professional
   communicators use the distribution of knowledge on teams as a structure
   for planning interventions in the work of complex, collaborative teams?
   2. What kinds of insights do networks of specific knowledge areas offer
   professional communicators about team communication challenges?
   Literature review: We describe prior uses of network analysis in
   professional communication research that inform our development of a
   knowledge network. In particular, we review current literature and
   highlight network-based concepts that we believe are organizing
   principles of knowledge networks. Previous literature has shown that
   network models, particularly social network models, are useful tools for
   professional communication researchers to examine a range of
   communication factors and practices. However, professional communication
   research has yet to fully explore the possible contributions of
   knowledge networks to understand communication processes. Methodology:
   We conducted an ethnography of a team science collaboration and used
   observations to create a survey of terms that measured subjects'
   self-professed understanding of key concepts. We used the survey results
   to produce a bimodal network model of agents and terms, in which we
   binarized link values after filtering for only the highest-rated terms
   for each subject. Results: The model demonstrated that the team
   collaboration broke into two distinct groupings. Ego networks extracted
   from this parent network showed that concepts commonly well-understood
   in the team join together multiple subgroups of expert knowledge.
   Conclusions: The knowledge network is a useful instrument in helping
   team members understand possibilities for integrating knowledge across
   disciplines and subspecialties. The visual produced by this model also
   can be useful for developing research questions and strategizing work
   processes.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Virtual reality (VR) has gained popularity across
   industries for its ability to engage users on a level unprecedented by
   print or 2-D media; however, few guidelines exist for the use of VR
   technologies in technical and professional communication (TPC)
   curricula. To address this need, this experience report details the
   study of a recognizable and adopted set of VR devices to promote
   understanding of the ways in which emerging VR technologies provide new
   approaches to pedagogy. Literature review: Drawing from literature in
   computer science, communication studies, and anthropology, as well as
   embodiment and phenomenology, the authors provide a historical account
   of VR development. About the study: Using three concurrent case studies
   and qualitative interviews, the authors share their deployment of three
   low-end to high-end VR devices: Google Cardboard, Google Daydream View,
   and HTC Vive. Using a modified heuristic, the authors assess the
   functions, features, and uses of the devices; showcase current or
   potential deployments; and for triangulation, provide a user study of
   two devices. Results/discussion: VR immersion can provide students with
   a deeper understanding of course content; immersion in future workplaces
   can give students an initial vision of their project and profession;
   concepts can be seen from new vantage points; and user themes include
   felt experience, sense and sensibility, agency and autonomy, and
   constant identities. Together, these themes provide an entry into
   discussions of designing VR content for technical and professional
   communication. Conclusion: The authors discuss limitations to VR
   integration and provide resources so practitioners might implement VR in
   engaging and relevant ways.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to provide insights on the perceptions of engineering
   students from two educational paths in Singapore of desired graduate
   attributes by employers. Research questions: (1) Do graduates from the
   polytechnic and junior college paths have similar perceptions with
   regard to the ranking of desirable graduate attributes? (2) If not, in
   what ways are their perceptions different? Literature review: A review
   of literature on employers' ranking of desirable graduate attributes
   revealed mismatches in employers' and graduates' rankings. There has not
   been any published study on student awareness of employability skills in
   Singapore in particular. Hence, this study investigated the perceptions
   of final-year engineering students from two different educational paths
   of their ranking of graduate attributes. Methodology: The students were
   asked to rank eight attributes and explain their ranking from an
   employer's perspective. Results: The findings show that communication,
   teamwork, and problem-solving were ranked the top three desirable
   attributes by both groups of students. However, polytechnic students
   seem to reflect greater familiarity and confidence in tackling workplace
   requirements compared to junior college students. The implications of
   the findings are presented.},

Abstract = {Research problem: In Ireland, technical communication has developed as
   an academic and occupational field since the late 20th century. Research
   on the field in Ireland is limited. Research questions: (1) To what
   extent do technical communicators in Ireland operate as a community of
   practice? (2) What steps are Irish technical communicators taking toward
   professionalization? Literature review: This study uses a theoretical
   framework that combines symbolic interactionism and communities of
   practice theories. While traditional professionalization theory uses a
   structural functionalist approach to the study of occupations,
   characterizing disciplines as professions depending on whether they meet
   certain traits (including autonomy, market closure, license to practice,
   and service orientation), symbolic interactionism prioritizes
   interactions among individuals. In this sense, it overlaps with the
   concerns of communities of practice. A community of practice involves a
   group of people working together, and creating meaning through their
   interactions. Studying an occupation through this lens foregrounds
   individual and community identity, and how that is formed and informed
   by work. Methodology: Mixed methods-a survey, focus groups, and
   interviews-were used to explore Irish technical communicators'
   perceptions of aspects of their field: practice, education, value and
   status, and professional and community structures. Results: The findings
   indicate that Irish technical communicators exhibit traits of
   communities of practice (such as joint enterprise and shared
   repertoires). They also identify with their job title and practice. A
   key finding is that some Irish technical communicators have a keen
   appetite for community involvement. This enthusiasm notwithstanding,
   barriers to professionalization include low visibility of the role in
   Ireland, limited evidence of professionalizing activity, and the
   potential for career stagnation.},

Title = {Personas in Heuristic Evaluation: An Exploratory Study},

Abstract = {Research problem: No study has explored how incorporating personas into
   heuristic evaluation of products, namely websites, affects the kinds of
   findings reported and the recommendations presented by usability
   evaluators. Research questions: (1) Do findings resulting from heuristic
   evaluations of a website without the use of personas differ from
   findings resulting from heuristic evaluations of the same website with
   the use of personas? (2) Do findings from persona-based heuristic
   evaluations in which evaluators develop their own personas differ from
   findings from persona-based heuristic evaluations in which evaluators
   are given personas? (3) If findings and recommendations are different,
   how do they differ? (4) How does the use of personas affect the
   evaluators' confidence in the findings of a heuristic evaluation?
   Literature review: First, previous research of heuristic evaluation has
   concluded that although heuristic evaluation is inexpensive and does not
   require advance planning, it has several shortcomings, including its
   too-intense focus on minor issues and its inability to capture all
   usability issues. Second, data-driven personas, which have long been a
   resource in user-centered design, have been suggested as a way to
   improve or enhance heuristic evaluation, and several studies suggest
   that usability professionals are indeed using personas in their
   evaluations. However, no empirical study has assessed heuristic
   evaluations that include personas. Methodology: In this exploratory
   study involving three sections of an advanced technical writing course,
   groups of evaluators conducted a heuristic evaluation of a website. Each
   section was randomly assigned a different condition with which they
   would conduct the heuristic evaluation: (a) a traditional heuristic
   evaluation, (b) a persona-led heuristic evaluation in which the personas
   were given to the evaluators, or (c) a persona-led heuristic evaluation
   in which the evaluators themselves created their own personas. Each
   group wrote a report identifying the major problems with the website and
   provided recommendations to solve the identified problems. The
   evaluators completed pretesting demographic surveys and posttesting
   confidence surveys. Results and discussion: This exploratory study found
   few detectable differences in the findings reported by groups that used
   personas in heuristic evaluation and groups that did not use personas.
   The groups that used personas were more likely to report findings
   related to navigation than the groups that did not use personas, while
   the groups that did not use personas were more likely to report findings
   related to design than the groups that used personas. The groups that
   created their own personas were more likely than the other groups to
   include complex issues in their reports and include language that
   directly references users and user needs. All groups were confident in
   their findings.},

Title = {Impact of Journals and Academic Reputations of Authors: A Structured
   Bibliometric Survey of the IEEE Publication Galaxy},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Research problem: This study explores the use of bibliometric indicators
   to objectively evaluate IEEE scientific journals from two different
   perspectives: (1) journal impact and diffusion and (2) the academic
   reputation of journal authors. Research questions: (1) Which journals
   are better at selecting articles with high scientific impact (measured
   by average citations per article), and publishing authors with strong
   reputations (measured by h-indices)? (2) Does the impact of journal
   articles correlate positively with the reputations of their authors? and
   (3) Can bibliometric indicators provide a simple way for journal editors
   to monitor journal performance in a manner complementary to traditional
   ISI impact factor (IF)? Literature review: This paper reviews literature
   on citation analysis, a bibliometric method of measuring impact based on
   the number of times a work is cited, and explains such bibliometric
   indicators as, Hirsch index, and IF which measure the impact of a
   journal, and introduces a new indicator called h-spectrum to objectively
   measure the reputation of a journal's author group. Methodology: This
   quantitative study performed citation analysis on 250,000 authors in 110
   IEEE journals using citation statistics from the Google Scholar, Web of
   Science, and Scopus databases to construct the h-spectrum indicator. The
   authors used automated filtering techniques to exclude questionable
   author data. Results and conclusions: The first phase of analysis
   indicated significant differences among IEEE publications in journal
   impact, and found that the h-index and were suitable for evaluating
   journals except in their most recent five years where annual rankings
   are proposed instead. The second phase of analysis found that h-spectra
   distributions of author reputation differ among journals in a single
   year, and are generally stable for a single journal over five years.
   Maps were constructed to locate journals graphically based on the
   complementary indicators of impact and reputation, and to show changes
   in impact and reputation over time. The maps indicated that journals
   with high impact tend to have authors with high reputations but the
   opposite is not necessarily true. Suggestions were made to explain
   different combinations of high and low impact and reputation for
   journals. The use of maps complements IF and provides a simple tool to
   monitor journal reputation at the time of most recent publication. The
   study is limited by assumptions about the value of citations, the
   reliability of search engine statistics, and the homogeneity of IEEE
   journal citation practices, as well as the failure to account for
   coauthors, article age, and authors who publish multiple times per year
   in the same journal. Future research could examine non-IEEE journals and
   normalize subfields within IEEE journals to avoid favoring fields that
   use more citations.},

Title = {Combining Concurrent Think-Aloud Protocols and Eye-Tracking
   Observations: An Analysis of Verbalizations and Silences},

Abstract = {Research problem: Concurrent think-aloud (CTA) protocols are one of the
   dominant approaches of usability testing. However, there is still debate
   about the validity of the method, partly focusing on the usefulness and
   exhaustiveness of participants' verbalizations. The rise of eye-tracking
   technology sheds new light on this discussion, as participants' working
   processes can now be observed in more detail. Research questions: (1)
   What kinds of verbalizations do participants produce, and how do they
   relate to the information that can be directly observed using eye
   tracking? (2) What do eye movements reveal about cognitive processes at
   times when participants stop verbalizing? Literature review: Our study
   replicates an earlier study by Cooke (2010), who used a combination of
   CTA protocols and eye tracking in a small sample with experienced and
   highly educated participants to investigate the validity of CTA. Cooke's
   results suggest that the additional value of participants'
   verbalizations is limited: at least 77\% of the verbalizations referred
   to things that could be easily observed with eye tracking. Methodology:
   We conducted a study in which 60 participants with different
   characteristics performed tasks on informational websites. During their
   task performance, they verbalized their thoughts, and simultaneously
   their eye movements were measured. The resulting think-aloud protocols
   were divided in verbalization units, which were coded into content
   types. Silences were registered, and eye movements during these silences
   were analyzed. Results and discussion: We found a different distribution
   of verbalization types than Cooke (2010) reported, with far more
   verbalizations where participants formulated doubts, judgments on the
   website, or expressions of frustration. In our study, verbalizations
   provided a substantial contribution in addition to the directly
   observable user problems. We measured a rather high percentage of
   silences (27\%), during which participants most often were scanning
   pages for information. During these silences, interesting observations
   could be made about users' processes and obstacles on the website. The
   implication of our study is that we now have a better understanding of
   the types of verbalizations that a CTA evaluation might generate.
   Further, we know that relevant usability observations can be made during
   silences. A limitation is that we do not know yet the influence of
   specific characteristics of the evaluation setting on the types of
   verbalizations and silences. Future research should focus on the
   influence of evaluation settings on the outcomes of an evaluation, in
   particular, the influence of characteristics of the participants who are
   involved in the study.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research problem: The study explored think-aloud methods usage within
   usability testing by examining the following questions: How, and why is
   the think-aloud method used? What is the gap between theory and
   practice? Where does this gap occur? Literature review: The review
   informed the survey design. Usability research based on field studies
   and empirical tests indicates that variations in think-aloud procedures
   may reduce test reliability. The guidance offered on think-aloud
   procedures within a number of handbooks on usability testing is also
   mixed. This indicates potential variability in practice, but how much
   and for what reasons is unknown. Methodology: An exploratory,
   qualitative survey was conducted using a web-based questionnaire (during
   November-December 2010). Usability evaluators were sought via emails
   (sent to personal contacts, usability companies, conference attendees,
   and special interest groups) to be cascaded to the international
   community. As a result we received 207 full responses. Descriptive
   statistics and thematic coding were used to analyze the data sets.
   Results: Respondents found the concurrent technique particularly suited
   usability testing as it was fast, easy for users to relate to, and
   requires limited resources. Divergent practice was reported in terms of
   think-aloud instructions, practice, interventions, and the use of
   demonstrations. A range of interventions was used to better understand
   participant actions and verbalizations, however, respondents were aware
   of potential threats to test reliability, and took steps to reduce this
   impact. Implications: The reliability considerations underpinning the
   classic think-aloud approach are pragmatically balanced against the need
   to capture useful data in the time available. A limitation of the study
   is the focus on the concurrent method; other methods were explored but
   the differences in application were not considered. Future work is
   needed to explore the impact of divergent use of think-aloud
   instructions, practice tasks, and the use of demonstrations on test
   reliability.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role that initial exchanges play in determining
   subsequent process and outcome in email-based negotiations, an
   increasingly popular means of conducting domestic and international
   negotiations. The results of the study suggest considerable symmetry
   between parties in terms of the quantity (words) and quality of initial
   messages. However, informal greetings, introductions, and proposal
   surfacing in these early exchanges played little role in determining the
   likelihood of an agreement or an integrative (win-win) outcome. In
   contrast, the parties' stated intentions of pursuing a mutually
   beneficial outcome and their exaggeration of initial offers
   significantly related to the likelihood of reaching an agreement. The
   implications of these findings for practitioners and future research are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Technical communicators need to be Prepared for the challenges of
   international Communication. This tutorial focuses on the need for
   technical communication faculty to prepare students to be skilled
   intercultural communicators and to play a role on the translation team.
   The tutorial begins with a discussion of the importance of writing for
   translation in the international workplace and then presents specific
   assignments designed to instruct students in intercultural communication
   and give them experience writing for translation. In addition to
   introducing Students to the cultural issues that impact the creation of
   documentation for international audiences, these assignments also serve
   to reinforce core skills recognized as vital to professional success in
   the field of technical communication. Taken together these assignments
   can be used as the basis for a Course in international technical
   communication. Art appendix to the tutorial includes numerous resources
   available to faculty who want either to develop a course in
   international technical communication or to include some of the
   assignments in existing technical communication courses.},

Abstract = {With the development of new technologies, and particularly information
   communication technologies (ICTs), teams have evolved to encompass new
   forms of interaction and collaboration. By focusing on the communicative
   dimensions of global virtual teams, this paper demonstrates that
   e-collaboration is more than a technological substitution for
   traditional face-to-face collaboration. It places special emphasis on
   the importance of structuring activities for balancing electronic
   communication during e-collaboration (i.e., videoconference, email, chat
   session, distributed use of group support system) to bridge cultural and
   stereotypical gaps, to increase profitable role repartition between the
   participants, and to prevent and solve conflicts. During the past four
   years, the authors have developed a project involving hundreds of
   participants from different national cultures working together for six
   weeks on a specific project. In this paper we present our experiences
   and draw conclusions, giving special attention to the structure of the
   electronic communication required to support efficient virtual teaming
   in education and industry.},

Abstract = {Innovation in a company's design process is increasingly a matter of
   cooperation between the company and its customers. New Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) possibilities such as electronic
   communication (EC) media generate even more opportunities for companies
   to collaborate with customers during the early stages of research and
   development. This exploratory study examined the design process of five
   Dutch firms and the cultural and communicative implications of
   cooperation in the design process between the supplier and the customer
   using EC media. We found that the selected use of EC media for
   communication between R\&D and customers has a positive effect on the
   design process. We also discovered that the characteristics of the most
   suitable EC media depend on the design activity, and that the corporate
   and professional cultures of both the company and its customers involved
   in the cooperation seem to affect the communication media used. Finally,
   the future use of new ICT in the design area is discussed.},

Abstract = {Research In computer-mediated communication has usually emphasized the
   cognitive over the social aspects of communication, the medium over the
   message, and the product of communication over the process. In contrast,
   this paper emphasizes three constructs of the communication process:
   goal-based communication strategies, message form, and medium, We seek
   to balance cognitive and social communication strategies and to combine
   new and old measures of the message form (organization, formality, and
   size). A field study in an academic institution examines the content of
   text-based communication delivered by letter memo, fax, and email. As
   expected, people prefer certain message and medium attributes for
   certain strategies, These findings are further investigated using
   open-ended interviews. We conclude with examples of practical
   implications on designing and implementing computer-mediated
   communication.},

Abstract = {Computer-mediated communication (CMC) has enabled relaxation of temporal
   and geographical boundaries surrounding group tasks. A question is
   whether this opening is appropriate mainly for information exchange or
   whether it is also conducive to the interactive moves necessary for
   group knowledge production. This study examines knowledge production via
   email in a technology standardization working group. It notes the
   occurrence of interactive moves and discusses how they are and can be
   affected for producing group knowledge.},
