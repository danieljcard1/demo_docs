KEY CONCEPTS: UNDERSTANDING HOW DATA CONTRIBUTE TO DISCUSSIONS OF PUBLIC PROBLEMS MATTERS, ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS DURING WHICH MULTIPLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. CRITICAL DATA STUDIES CLARIFIES HOW DATA PRACTICE AND PRIORITIES EMERGING FROM VARIOUS DOMAINS OF POWER EXACERBATE STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES. IF WE RECOGNIZE, REVEAL, AND REJECT DATA PRACTICES THAT CAST DATA AS IF THEY WERE NEUTRAL OR FIXED, WE CAN ENSURE THAT OUR DATA PRACTICES AS TPC PROFESSIONALS ARE MORE JUST. KEY LESSONS: 1. RECOGNIZE THAT DATA ARE SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED AND OFTEN INCOMPLETE. 2. REVEAL THE OVERARCHING SOCIAL, POLITICAL, CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT SHAPE DATA COLLECTION AND BY EXTENSION, DATA ITSELF. 3. REJECT FAULTY OR BIASED PROCESSES FOR DATA INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS THAT PERPETUATE INEQUALITY. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DATA AND CONTEXT, WE CAN PROMOTE BETTER, MORE JUST DATA PRACTICES, PREPARING TPC PROFESSIONALS TO WORK ALONGSIDE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS IN INTERSECTIONAL COALITIONS AND CHALLENGING THE CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO UNJUST DATA THAT FAIL TO REPRESENT, OVER-REPRESENT, OR BLATANTLY MISREPRESENT THE REALITIES OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.},

  Ab = {INTRODUCTION: THIS EXPERIENTIAL TEACHING CASE STUDY CALLS FOR TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATORS TO APPLY A COMBINATION OF ABLEISM STUDIES AND DISABILITY JUSTICE IN EXAMINING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN POTENTIALLY ABLEIST, NORMATIVE SYSTEMS. SITUATING THE CASE: PREVIOUS TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION (TPC) SCHOLARSHIP HAS DEMONSTRATED HOW THE FIELD OF DISABILITY STUDIES (DS) FURTHERS TPC'S GOALS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, BUT IT HAS NOT OFFERED METHODS TO TRACE THE SYSTEMIC ABLEIST ASSUMPTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY'S MARGINALIZATION. I THUS EXTEND THESE CONSIDERATIONS THROUGH ATTENTION TO DISABILITY JUSTICE AND ABLEISM STUDIES. ABOUT THE CASE: THIS TEACHING CASE EVALUATES MY ATTEMPT TO INCORPORATE DS INTO MY WRITING FOR THE PROFESSIONS CLASS BY EXAMINING THE WARRANTS OR ASSUMPTIONS REFLECTED IN CLASS MATERIALS AND STUDENT DISCUSSIONS TO DETERMINE HOW DS'S INCLUSION IN THE COURSE IMPACTED SUCH WARRANTS. METHODS/APPROACH: I USED THEMATIC CODING TO ANALYZE CLASS DOCUMENTS, STUDENT WORK, AND SEMISTRUCTURED STUDENT INTERVIEWS AND TRACED HOW REFLECTED WARRANTS CONTRIBUTED TO UNDERSTANDINGS OF ABILITY AND DISABILITY. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: I FOUND THAT ANALYZED DOCUMENTS PREDOMINANTLY RELIED ON ABLEIST WARRANTS THAT OBSCURED DISABILITY'S RELATIONALITY, POSITIONED DISABILITY AS DEVIANCE, LIMITED EFFORTS TOWARDS SOCIAL CHANGE, AND DISREGARDED DISABILITY'S INTERSECTIONAL COMPLEXITY. CONCLUSION: TO COUNTER THE USE OF ABLEIST WARRANTS THAT IMPEDE SOCIAL JUSTICE GOALS, I RECOMMEND THAT TPC INSTRUCTORS FOSTER CRITICAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF SYSTEMIC ABLEISM BY APPLYING DISABILITY JUSTICE PRINCIPLES TO THEIR COURSE MATERIALS. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ABLEISM STUDIES AND DISABILITY JUSTICE, TPC CAN PURSUE MORE SOCIALLY JUST DOCUMENTATION PRACTICES.},

  Ab = {THIS TUTORIAL EXPLORES ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY AND INTERSECTIONAL THEORY ON TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION, AND PROPOSES PLAIN LANGUAGE AS AN ETHICAL IMPERATIVE TO REDRESS SOCIAL INEQUITIES. KEY CONCEPTS: WHEN THE COGNITIVE LOAD OF A LEARNING TASK IS TOO HIGH AND OVERWHELMS WORKING MEMORY, LEARNING IS IMPAIRED. THE GREATER STRESS AND MENTAL BURDEN THAT MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS EXPERIENCE CAN LEAVE LESS WORKING MEMORY AVAILABLE FOR READING AND LEARNING. USING PLAIN LANGUAGE TO REDUCE COGNITIVE LOAD CAN BE CONSIDERED A POLITICAL ACT THAT INCREASES MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS' OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND. KEY LESSONS: 1. CONSIDER WHETHER MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS ARE PART OF YOUR AUDIENCE. 2. USING PERSONAS TO REPRESENT THOSE POPULATIONS, AUDIT THEIR MENTAL BURDEN TO EXERCISE COGNITIVE EMPATHY. 3. CONSIDER REDUCING COGNITIVE LOAD VIA PLAIN LANGUAGE AN ETHICAL IMPERATIVE. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: ASSESSING THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC MARGINALIZED GROUPS IS ITERATIVE AND TAKES PRACTICE, BUT DEVELOPING PLAIN-LANGUAGE COMMUNICATIONS THAT ACCOMMODATE THESE AUDIENCES REDUCES COGNITIVE LOAD FOR ALL READERS.

  Ab = {ABOUT THE CASE: FIRST-GENERATION LATINX STUDENTS IN TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION (TPC) AND OTHER GRADUATE PROGRAMS REPRESENT A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS, YET STORIES OF THEIR EXPERIENCES WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION REMAIN MUTED. WE ANALYZED 10 LATINX TESTIMONIOS (CULTURALLY SITUATED NARRATIVES) WHEREIN THEY VOICE THEIR EXPERIENCES AS FIRST-GENERATION STUDENTS IN US GRADUATE PROGRAMS. TESTIMONIALISTAS EXPRESSED HOW THEY NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF BEING FIRST-GENERATION STUDENTS AND DESCRIBED HOW THEY PERSIST AND ENACT SOCIAL JUSTICE. SITUATING THE CASE: TPC PROGRAMS MAY EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL INJUSTICES AND STUDENT RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, YET THERE IS A DEARTH OF LITERATURE REGARDING SPECIFIC OBSTACLES THAT LATINX STUDENTS FACE. WE EXAMINED HOW THEY BUILD SUCCESS THROUGH COALITIONAL ACTION AND CULTURALLY INFORMED TACTICAL DECISION-MAKING. METHODS: WE RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS WHO SELF-IDENTIFIED AS FIRST-GENERATION LATINX STUDENTS IN TPC AND OTHER GRADUATE PROGRAMS. WE CONDUCTED AND RECORDED SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW SESSIONS BASED IN TESTIMONIO AND INTERSECTIONAL FEMINIST METHODOLOGIES. WE USED QUALITATIVE DATA CODING AND MAXQDA CODING SOFTWARE TO ASSEMBLE AND MAP SOCIAL JUSTICE THEMES AT WORK ACROSS THE TESTIMONIOS. RESULTS: ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT FIRST-GENERATION LATINX GRADUATE STUDENTS DRAW ON COMPLEX INFORMAL AND FORMAL NETWORKS TO AID THEIR SUCCESS, DESIRE MORE EFFECTIVE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE MENTORSHIP, AND DEVELOP TACTICAL DECISION-MAKING SKILLS TO CIRCUMVENT OPPRESSIVE BEHAVIORS. CONCLUSIONS: WE SUGGEST THAT DIRECTORS, MENTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, FACULTY, AND LATINX STUDENTS BEGIN WITH A SOCIAL JUSTICE FRAMEWORK TO BETTER LISTEN TO, UNDERSTAND, AND ADDRESS FIRST-GENERATION LATINX COLLEGE EXPERIENCES AND BUILD COHORT-BASED SUPPORT MECHANISMS INTO PROGRAMMATIC OBJECTIVES AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS.},

  Ab = {INTRODUCTION: THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN APPROACH THAT WE CALL CRITICAL COLLABORATION -AN ARRAY OF THEORETICAL COMMITMENTS DRAWN FROM THE AUTHORS' EMBODIMENTS AND LIVED EXPERIENCES. IN MAKING EXPLICIT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN AUTHORIAL EMBODIMENT AND THE CONTENT OF THEORY AND PRACTICE, OUR PRACTICAL MODELS DEMONSTRATE NEW AND VARIED APPROACHES TO PUBLIC FEMINISMS. WE BEGIN WITH A DISCUSSION OF EMBODIMENT AND THEN OFFER FOUR SECTIONS-AMPLIFICATION RHETORICS, APPARENT FEMINISMS, A TECHNE OF MARGINALITY, AND MEMETIC RHETORICAL ENVIRONMENTS-WITH KEY TAKEAWAYS TO GUIDE READERS THROUGH OUR RELATED-BUT-DIFFERENT APPROACHES. OUR GOAL IN DOING SO IS TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC FEMINISMS TO ENACTING SOCIAL JUSTICE IN TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. THIS MEANS RECOGNIZING OUR OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO UNJUST TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION. TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION IS NOT A UTOPIA OF INCLUSION AND ANTI-RACISM-ALTHOUGH SOME CORNERS OF THE FIELD ARE DEDICATED TO THOSE TOPICS, TO BE SURE. RATHER, DESPITE THE SOCIAL JUSTICE TURN, SOME PARTS OF THE FIELD STILL INSIST ON OBJECTIVITY, NEUTRALITY, AND PRACTICALITY AS THE TOUCHSTONES FOR ``GOOD'' TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION. OUR WORK HERE SHOWS SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MIGHT RESIST THE CULTURAL BLINDERS THAT ALLOW SUCH IDEAS TO PERSIST UNABATED. DRAWING ESPECIALLY ON RESEARCH IN RHETORIC AND EMBODIMENT STUDIES, WE BUILD INTERDISCIPLINARY BRIDGES WITH CRITICAL RACE STUDIES (INCLUDING CRITICAL RACE FEMINISMS), WOMANISM, GENDER STUDIES, TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION, BLACK RHETORICS, QUEER STUDIES, CULTURAL STUDIES, AND RHETORICAL GENRE STUDIES, AMONG OTHER FIELDS, TO PROVIDE A SET OF PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO PUBLIC FEMINIST EXIGENCIES THAT RESIST COLLAPSING ALL FEMINISMS INTO A SINGLE APPROACH. WE ARGUE THAT DRAWING ON EMBODIMENT TO DEVELOP A MULTIPLICITY OF FEMINIST APPROACHES AND ENGAGING IN CRITICAL COLLABORATION AS THOSE APPROACHES EVOLVE IS A WAY FORWARD THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE FRUITFULLY IN PUBLIC FEMINIST PROJECTS. OUR HOPE IS THAT READERS CAN THEN IMAGINE PUBLIC FEMINISMS AS ONE AVENUE FOR DOING THE SOCIAL JUSTICE WORK THAT IS VITAL TO THE GROWTH OF TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION AS A FIELD.},

  Ab = {PURPOSE: TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION (TC) ACADEMIC PROGRAMS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAINING FUTURE TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION PRACTITIONERS. INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE FIELD STARTS WITH INCREASING DIVERSITY IN ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND HELPING STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS TO GRADUATE. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN A LACK OF DIVERSITY IN TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND A LACK OF INCLUSIVE PRACTICES IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN GENERAL. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO SHOW HOW TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS CAN INCREASE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED RACIAL AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS THROUGH BETTER INCLUSION.METHOD: I CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND PRE-TENURED FACULTY MEMBERS REGARDING THEIR EXPERIENCES IN TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED, TRANSCRIBED, AND CODED FOR EMERGING THEMES.RESULTS: INTERVIEW PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL AREAS WHERE TC ACADEMIC PROGRAMS CAN INCREASE INCLUSION, INCLUDING FOCUSING ON INCLUSION RATHER THAN SIMPLY INCREASING DIVERSITY, PROBLEMS WITH MICROAGGRESSIONS, LACK OF REPRESENTATION, AND THE COMPLICATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY INTERSECTIONALITY.CONCLUSION: TC ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, LIKE HIGHER EDUCATION IN GENERAL, ARE INTERESTED IN INCREASING DIVERSITY. HOWEVER, RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON SIMPLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, TC PROGRAMS SHOULD FOCUS ON INCREASING PROGRAM INCLUSIVENESS. THIS INCLUDES ACTIVELY INCLUDING DIVERSE VOICES IN PROGRAM DECISION MAKING AND BEING WILLING TO MAKE CHANGES BASED ON THE THOUGHTS, IDEAS, AND OPINIONS OF TRADITIONALLY MARGINALIZED PEOPLE. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS CAN ALSO BE USED BY PRACTITIONERS TO BEGIN INCREASING INCLUSION IN THE WORKPLACE.},
