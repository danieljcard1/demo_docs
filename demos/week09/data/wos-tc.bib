Title = {What They Were Thinking: Communal Rationality, Strategic Action Fields,
   and the Launch Plan for OxyContin},

Abstract = {Purpose: Few studies in our field have investigated corporate
   communications at the origins of the United States opioid crisis, which
   arguably began around the mid-1990s. Such analyses can illuminate
   executives and managers' collective thinking at the time (that is,
   ``communal rationality{''}), nuance our public narratives, and recommend
   ways that technical communicators can engage further with this public
   health tragedy. Thus, this article surfaces the communal rationality
   expressed in the launch plan for OxyContin, which I obtained through a
   Freedom of Information Act request. This is perhaps the first close
   reading of a pharmaceutical launch plan in our scholarly literature.
   Method: Following precedent in other research, I applied a three-point
   heuristic based on the concept of strategic action fields: what is going
   on and what is at stake, what interpretive frames are constructed, and
   what the rules of the game are. Results: The communal rationality
   expressed in the launch plan involves a complex tangle of cultural
   knowledge, including state and national laws, guidelines, classes of
   analgesics, and industry practices. The writers effectively translate
   this knowledge into opportunities, positioning statements, strategies,
   and tactics. Conclusion: In some ways, the launch plan is an exemplary
   piece of technical and professional communication, but its treatment of
   ethics and risk is highly problematic-arguably making it an example of
   communication failure as well. Future research should delve deeper into
   the opioid crisis, exploring additional promotions, genres, drugs, and
   methodologies.},

Title = {The Roles of Medium and Narrative Believability in Guided Mobile Tour
   Navigation},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},

Pages = {76-96},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study investigates the role of need for cognition and
   narrative believability when using a mobile device to take a guided tour
   of a new location, informing future research and practice in both
   narrative design and media ecology.
   Method: Experiment participants (n = 141) toured a new research facility
   using one of three combinations of navigation aids (a smartphone only, a
   brochure and a smartphone, or a brochure only) as a guide. An ordinal
   regression analysis and multivariate regression analysis were used to
   assess the relationships among navigation aids, narrative believability,
   need for cognition, and perceived ease of navigation.
   Results: Use of a smartphone only or a brochure in tandem with a
   smartphone were positively related to evaluations of the narrative as
   highly consistent as well as perceptions that the narrative offered a
   high degree of coverage. However, using a brochure in tandem with a
   smartphone was negatively related to perceived ease of navigation, while
   narrative plausibility had a positive effect on perceived ease of
   navigation.
   Conclusion: This study illustrates how different mobile devices result
   in a range of interpretations of the same materials and, ultimately,
   different levels of success in real -world navigation. Even a simple
   narrative can aid wayfinding if users find it sufficiently plausible.
   More broadly, the results suggest the need for research to facilitate
   the development of more engaging multimedia tour guides.},

Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {272-283},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: The goal of this article is to understand how and why content
   relating to a popular nutrition program, the Whole30, is taken up or
   discarded when shifting between producer- and participant-controlled
   media.
   Method: This article utilizes memetic rhetorical analysis to identify
   interface- and content-specific memes and to explore the connections
   between those memes that create environments to which some adapt
   successfully while other are lost.
   Results: My analysis shows that the interface memes that characterize
   the Whole30 Facebook Community page create a communicative situation in
   which personal experience is more likely to be persuasive than
   scientific research or institutionally conferred credentials.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators need to craft technical and
   scientific content to allow for transmediated community interaction that
   draws on the affordances of social media sites to maintain the integrity
   of information.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},

Number = {1},
Pages = {53-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Professional communicators are becoming more invested in unique
   configurations of power in organizations, including non-hierarchical and
   democratic workplaces. While organizations dedicated to democratic
   processes may enact power differently than conventional organizations,
   they may fall short of practicing equality. This article explains the
   differences in non-hierarchical workplaces, considers businesses where
   democracy is a goal, and argues for considering equality as a habitual
   practice, particularly when writing regulatory documents.
   Method: We conduct a review of the literature on non-hierarchical
   workplaces and organizational democracy, applying Jacques Ranciere's
   concept of equality to two examples (one using primary data collection
   and one using secondary data) of two cooperatives where organizational
   democracy is integral to the design of the business.
   Results: The literature review exposes an interest in metis (cunning,
   craftiness, flexibility) as vital to practitioner success in
   non-hierarchical workplaces; however, this article demonstrates that
   metis does not prevent inequality, even in organizations expressly
   committed to workplace democracy.
   Conclusion: Professional communicators need to consider equality not
   solely as a structural resource (as in rules, laws, policies) but as a
   habitual practice to cultivate alongside other characteristics and
   frameworks important to a professional communicator's toolkit.},

Title = {YouTube Beauty Tutorials as Technical Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-308},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: With the increasing popularity of YouTube beauty videos, this
   study extends previous research on YouTube instructional videos by
   investigating the common characteristics of the 10 most-reviewed makeup
   and hair tutorials to determine their similarity to or differences from
   good instructional videos.
   Method: Using a deductive coding method, I analyzed the 10 most-viewed
   beauty tutorials based on Swarts' (2012) best practices for creating
   instructional videos and Mackiewicz's (2010) assertion categories of
   expertise.
   Results: A majority of the videos followed best practices, such as
   including an introduction, beginning with a ``promise{''} or a clear
   objective, incorporating verbal instruction, being strategically
   redundant, and using a combination of text annotations, audio, and/or
   still images to complement the video. However, a lack of confidence and
   quality in most of the videos suggest that the creators did not rehearse
   their scripts, nor did they use the recording and editing tools
   effectively. None of the creators seems to provide any reassurance to
   the viewers or promote a sense of their self-efficacy. In terms of
   asserting their credibility, the majority of the creators did not make
   any explicit assertions about their relevant role, product-specific
   experience, or familiarity with related and relevant products.
   Conclusion: Although best practices, such as having a clear objective
   and using verbal instructions, should be followed, instructional video
   designers should also consider additional factors, such as truthfulness
   and accuracy, accessibility, kairos, addressivity, personal narratives,
   and humor.},

Title = {The Technical Communication Editing Test: Three Studies on This
   Assessment Type},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {215-231},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this paper, I present the results of three studies on
   editing tests used to screen prospective technical communicators and the
   error types common to these tests. Because few publically available,
   authentic examples exist, I first explore the general characteristics of
   55 tests and 71 error types. Error types are correlated against 176
   professionals' perceptions of these error types.
   Method: The sample's characteristics were first identified from the
   tests and the hiring managers. Three raters then independently
   classified the errors types using coding schemas from previous
   taxonomies of college-level writing. Finally, a 24-question survey was
   administered to capture professional communicators' perceptions of
   error.
   Results: Editing tests were typically designed in narrative format and
   evaluated holistically, but variation in administration and format
   existed. The sample included 3,568 errors and 71 error types. Errors
   related to wrong words, spelling, and capitalization dominated, but 13
   other errors were frequently found as well as dispersed within at least
   50\% of the sample. Conversely, professionals were bothered most by
   apostrophe errors, homonyms, and sentence fragments. No significant
   correlations were found among the frequencies and dispersions of the
   editing tests' errors and the professionals' perceptions of those
   errors.
   Conclusions: Editing tests share common characteristics, but
   organizational context substantially influences its format and contents.
   There were consistencies between the editing test error types and types
   identified in college-writing taxonomies; however, context again
   influences why errors are introduced as well as the types of errors that
   were identified. Finally, hiring managers and professionals share
   different perceptions of error. Understanding these differences can
   produce better assessment tools and better prepare test takers.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To present a significant historical document in the
   decades-long movement to professionalize technical communication
   Methods: Historical analysis and textual editing
   Results: Light's 1961 article applied then-current definitions of a
   profession to technical writing and suggested that technical writers
   could become professionals only through formal education and training.
   Conclusions: On the 50th anniversary of its publication, Light's article
   illustrates the tenor of discussions about professionalization in the
   early years of our profession and invites comparison with current
   professionalization discussions.},

Title = {Lost in Content Management: Constructing Quality as a Global Technical
   Communication Metric},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-52},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: As the demand for creating multilingual information products
   increases, so does the need to manage the costs of translation and to
   have sound approaches to producing high-quality multilingual texts.
   While component content management (CCM) is committed to both cost
   reduction and quality improvement, it also presents several challenges
   to multilingual quality. In this article, I present approaches for
   constructing multilingual quality as a global TC metric.
   Method: This article relies on the results of two surveys, one conducted
   through technical communication venues and one through technical
   translation venues.
   Results: The surveys identified contradictions in the beliefs and
   practices of multilingual quality in CCM environments that led to
   problems with multilingual quality. I group the contradictions and
   problems with the help of the activity theory lens and, based on this
   grouping, present questions that global technical communication project
   teams can ask themselves to improve their work practices.
   Conclusions: Effective communication between stakeholders and the
   knowledge of end-users are the two prerequisites to creating
   high-quality multilingual information products in CCM environments.
   Approaches to multilingual quality need to be collaborative and highly
   contextualized-dependent on business goals, user needs, and available
   resources. Taking the lead in multilingual quality management is one
   area for technical communicators to add value to their organizations.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-18},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Measuring the quality of product reviews via helpfulness votes
   is problematic for several reasons. I delineate the components of
   product review quality in order to assist technical communicators who
   manage their organizations' user-generated content in identifying
   quality content and in helping reviewers produce quality content.
   Method/Corpus: I analyze results from secondary research on product
   reviews and discuss six important components of review quality. I focus
   most attention on five components of review quality that technical
   communicators can assess-informativeness, valance, credibility,
   conformity, and readability-and briefly describe a sixth component-user
   characteristics. I also exemplify these components, drawing from a
   corpus of 8,973 product reviews gathered in 2013 from a variety of
   retail and review websites.
   Results: Based on this analysis, I recommend strategies that technical
   communicators can use (1) to identify these components of review
   quality, (2) to develop a rich data set from which they can glean
   consumer wants and needs as well as trends related to their
   organizations' products, and (3) to help reviewers write better reviews.
   Conclusions: As the amount of user-generated content grows, the need to
   learn from it and the need to improve it grow. By using their knowledge
   and skills in new ways, technical communicators who manage and develop
   product reviews can stay relevant and necessary as organizations rely
   more and more heavily on user-generated content.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {293-306},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: To explore strategies, goals, and practices that are part of a
   sustainable content strategy for the evolution and development of the
   technical communication body of knowledge and, by implication, other
   bodies of knowledge.
   Method: To develop a sustainable content strategy for the body of
   knowledge project, informed by content analysis, user generated survey
   data, and benchmarked trends from other knowledge bases.
   Results: An important part of content strategy for a large-scale
   knowledge base, such as the TCBOK, involves innovating practices with
   regard to the information taxonomy, tools, content assets, and
   information development standards, as the product and user base matures.
   Successful technical communication knowledge bases employ taxonomies
   with higher level topics that represent specific disciplines and
   sub-disciplines within technical communication. Integrating the human
   user into content strategy involves a complex interplay of user
   expectation and feasible decision making.
   Conclusions: Developing a body of knowledge, particularly over time, may
   require an integrated or hybrid approach to content strategy, involving
   a complex set of factors that include the human user, content assets,
   and sustainable practices. Content strategy goals and objectives are
   also a function of the maturity of the user base and the content itself
   within a body of knowledge.},

Title = {The Use of Online Collaborative Writing Tools by Technical Communication
   Practitioners and Students},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-44},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated technical communication practitioners'
   and students' use of online collaborative writing tools (OCWTs), as well
   as their opinions about these tools. This family of tools includes
   wikis, online word processors, learning management systems (LMSs), and
   other collaborative tools. The data gathered were used to illustrate
   these tools' value to practitioners, as well as provide educators with
   recommendations about which tools to teach students.
   Method: Surveys were deployed to technical communication practitioners
   and students; each group had its own survey. The surveys gathered
   quantitative and qualitative data. The qualitative data were analyzed
   through a coding system.
   Results: Roughly 85\% of both groups used OCWTs; however, practitioners
   used them daily while students used them only weekly. Practitioners
   primarily used tools chosen by their companies, and their most-used
   tools were Microsoft SharePoint, Google Docs, and company intranet.
   Students were features driven, and their most-used tools were Google
   Docs, PBWorks (formerly PBWiki), and Blackboard. Both groups had
   positive opinions overall about OCWTs.
   Conclusion: Technical communication practitioners appear to be using
   these tools often in the workplace, and several OCWTs appear to have
   become standards. These tools seem to hold value for practitioners, who
   use them for a wide variety of collaborative tasks. Technical
   communication students and educators should be aware of the OCWTs and
   collaborative tasks found in industry so that students can learn them.
   These tools include wikis, online word processors, and SharePoint (or
   something similar, such as an LMS). Finally, some tasks that
   practitioners perform (single sourcing, project management, and so
   forth) appear unfamiliar to students-it would be beneficial if students
   learned to perform these tasks in the classroom.},

Title = {``From Homeless to Human Again{''}: A Teaching Case on an Undergraduate
   ``Tiny Houses and Technical Writing{''} Course Model},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {88-101},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This teaching case discusses a community-engaged,
   service-learning based, undergraduate introductory technical
   communication course that employed storytelling as a pedagogical method
   and a key element in the deliverables produced, including instructional
   documents for volunteers, program informational brochures for potential
   volunteers, and a guidebook for a new career readiness construction
   training program for program participants.
   Method: The course, titled ``Tiny Houses and Technical Writing{''}
   partnered with a local 501(c)3 non-profit organization, Tiny House
   Community Development (THCD), which builds free tiny homes and offers
   construction-based career training programs for those experiencing
   homelessness. We used several techniques to elevate our community
   partner's narrative and highlight local issues of homelessness,
   utilizing storytelling and personas as methods to provide human-centered
   designs. We also employed technical communication's emphases on optimal
   format, arrangement, and style to revise and build documents. The course
   engaged in project-based service by producing various technical
   documents as well as providing direct service building tiny homes; this
   work was often completed alongside clients the THCD organization serves.
   Ultimately, we aimed to engage the stories of those the organization
   serves and reflect those stories within the deliverables.
   Results: The students in this course ultimately helped THCD streamline
   communications, increase build productivity, and communicate its mission
   to the local community. Additionally, the organization used several of
   our documents in a grant competition and ultimately won \$12,000 in
   future funding. We believe the storytelling element present in the
   technical documents elevated these communications. The course also
   sparked several new collaborations, conversations, and publications,
   thus propelling the organization's stories-and its human elements-into
   the larger community.
   Conclusion: ``Tiny Houses and Technical Writing{''} serves as an example
   of a community partnership model for undergraduate introductory
   technical writing courses and tiny house building groups.},

Title = {Post-Fact Fact Sheets: Dissociative Framing as a Strategy to Work Past
   Climate Change Denial},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {41-60},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article presents a new rhetorical model for science and
   technical communication-specifically climate change communication-which
   the author is calling dissociative framing, in which climate change can
   be dissociated from the behaviors necessary to mitigate the human
   contribution to climate change, while positive associations are formed
   with those behaviors. This model serves as an alternative to the
   knowledge deficit model still in use in much science communication and
   is applicable both for students and practitioners of technical
   communication.
   Method: The model was developed by examining Matthew Nisbet's work on
   framing in conjunction with Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's work on
   dissociation. I conducted a coded rhetorical analysis of two fact sheets
   produced by the Utah State University Extension Office with information
   on how their audience can change personal behaviors to mitigate their
   personal impact on climate change. I suggest how a dissociative frame
   would present the information more effectively.
   Results: A dissociative framing model can provide practitioners in
   technical and professional communication (TPC) a way to work around
   science skepticism and motivate action, especially when working with
   short, community-based genres, and can provide teachers of technical
   communication with a heuristic for instructing students on how to best
   engage a skeptical audience.
   Conclusion: While rural communities in the United States are especially
   prone to climate skepticism, it is important that they be informed and
   empowered to make the necessary behavioral changes to mitigate the human
   impact on climate change. Fact sheets published by extension services
   provide an excellent opportunity to inform and empower. A dissociative
   framing model provides a clear way to empower these communities with
   knowledge of how to mitigate their impact on climate change without
   diving into the political issues embroiled in climate science.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-162},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: In complex content ecosystems, a consumable, visual view of the
   content landscape is necessary to describe a strategy for future content
   development. This article explains our content landscape, the rationale
   behind the development of a new visual method to represent that
   landscape, and the resulting analysis to support an overall content
   strategy.
   Method: We present a technique that we used to analyze our complex
   content ecosystem of technical content and our approach to develop a
   consistent content strategy across documentation sets for diverse, yet
   interrelated products. We analyzed approaches that describe content
   strategy tools and processes for websites and for content reuse at the
   topic level, but found those lacking in support for complex technical
   content. Using that background, we designed our own tool and processes
   to support content analysis and strategy at the publication level. We
   developed the concept of a deliverable map, a visual representation of
   our content landscape by product category. The deliverable map became a
   highly effective tool in our efforts to define, communicate, and sustain
   our content strategy.
   Results: Multiple deliverable maps show existing content and
   relationships, and provide opportunities for different levels of
   analysis and stakeholder engagement. This analysis supports development
   and maintenance of a content strategy that meets business goals and that
   drives content across multiple outputs. The deliverable maps communicate
   current state, show the evolution of deliverables, identify content
   issues, and guide future planning.
   Conclusion: While the content in a content strategy initiative is
   typically thought of as small topics or webpages, it can be traditional
   publications also, such as technical manuals. Established content
   strategy practices can be adapted and successfully applied to content at
   all levels of granularity to meet the unique requirements of the
   organization. Spreadsheets are often the primary tool for documenting
   current-state content and planning future strategy. However, replacing
   spreadsheets with visual maps can be a more effective approach for
   complex, interrelated content landscapes. The interactive map becomes an
   invaluable tool to help create, communicate, and sustain a cohesive
   content strategy.},

Title = {Genre Chameleon: Email, Professional Writing Curriculum, and Workplace
   Writing Expectations},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-92},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Inspired by the National Commission on Writing's 2004 job
   market survey, we sought to verify that our professional writing
   curriculum met the needs of local employers, and to test if a demand
   exists for a writing major. Our study explores workplace genre
   conventions in light of responses.
   Method: Using a grounded theory approach, we gathered data in two stages
   using a mixed-methods design of interviews and questionnaires.
   Results: Seventy-three percent of respondents indicated that their
   respective companies require greater than three quarters of salaried
   employees to produce formal workplace writing. Further, most respondents
   (92\%) affirmed that prospective professional/salaried employees are
   ``almost always{''} adversely affected by poorly written materials.
   Respondents defined ``poor writing{''} in prospective and new hires in a
   variety of ways. All respondents chose Email as a ``daily genre of
   writing{''} that eclipses the popularity of any other genre. Applicants
   and new hires were perceived negatively if ``formal{''} written email
   skills were absent.
   Conclusion: New hires' genre convention mistakes are interpreted as lack
   of training or skill, or knowledge errors. We posit that novices must
   adapt to the company writing culture, learning the communicative
   threshold concepts as they would other aspects of company culture. We
   posit email has a new, descriptive grammar, altogether-a set of rules
   deployed in individual workplaces that may not carry over to the next
   employer. So, we propose that email be taught and recognized in
   workplaces as what we have termed a ``chameleon genre,{''} a genre that
   does whatever its users want it to do.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Pages = {76-94},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: The risk to the safety, identity, and vitality of a community
   is important for every citizen with a dangerous neighbor, be it military
   installations, oil refineries, nuclear power facilities, fertilizer
   factories, airports, or train stations. The historical case of Port
   Chicago-a failed relationship of a military facility and its neighboring
   civilian community-offers important lessons regarding the nefarious
   practice of erasive rhetoric and the missed opportunities for
   cultivating cooperation and communication.
   Method: A critical review of historical records and pertinent
   communications from military and civilian sources uncovers a series of
   rhetorical practices damaging to the safety, identity, and vitality of a
   community.
   Results: The language practices of name-changing, dismissive and
   derogatory descriptions, passive voice, negative claims, tactical
   omissions, and elaborate pejorative detail, separately and collectively,
   serve to fortify the source of danger while erasing the object of
   danger.

Title = {Comparing the Multimodality of Chinese and US Corporate Homepages: The
   Importance of Understanding Local Cultures},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {55-71},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this cross-cultural study, we investigated the similarities
   and differences in the multimodality of Chinese and U.S. corporate
   homepages. Method: We collected the homepages of 35 Chinese and 35 U.S.
   companies' local websites. We developed a framework for annotating
   different types of multimodal elements presented on corporate homepages.
   Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, we compared the
   verbal-visual composition and arrangement on Chinese and U.S. homepages
   in terms of textual, pictorial, diagrammatic, and video elements.
   Results: We found salient differences in the use of multimodal resources
   between Chinese and U.S. homepages. Chinese homepages overall made
   greater use of textual and video resources, with emphasis placed on
   directional textual elements and Flash animations and videos. They also
   tended to arrange multiple news titles in a list, employ parallelly
   placed pictures, and use more QR codes. In contrast, U.S. homepages
   preferred to present individual news headlines with news summaries
   attached, use one large background picture with subordinate elements
   embedded in them, and offer more social media icons for further
   connection. Conclusion: The differentiated approaches to deploying
   multimodal resources between Chinese and U.S. corporate homepages were
   closely associated with the distinctive cultural orientations and
   communication styles between these two countries.},

Title = {Contextualizing the 4Rs Heuristic with Participant Stories},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {8-25},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article explores the strategies technical and professional
   communicators use in addressing issues of social injustice in their
   daily lives, including academic workplaces and communities. In embracing
   a storytelling approach and Black Feminist epistemology, we explore the
   limits of traditional heuristics, illustrating the need to couple
   storytelling and lived experience with heuristic frameworks.
   Method: This study employs a qualitative, narrative inquiry methodology
   and semi structured interview data collection approaches.
   Results: Two elements of Walton, Moore, and Jones' (2019) 4Rs heuristic
   were expanded upon and further articulated through participant stories.
   To help people develop the ability to recognize injustice, data
   identified three sources for building expertise: lived experience,
   reading and proximity to lived experience, and accumulation within and
   across experiences. Revealing injustices occurred through both planned,
   often written, responses and in-the-moment responses.
   Conclusion: Stories and lived experience can augment our understanding
   of how heuristics work in context and provide a source of critical
   imagination for those attempting to use heuristics.},

Title = {Next-Gen Resumes: A Case Study of Using Transmedia Storytelling to
   Create Personal Branding on LinkedIn},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {230-243},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: The focus of this article is to examine how professionals may
   be adapting the once-stable resume genre to a next-generation (next-gen)
   iteration of this genre by using multiple media to create and sustain
   personal branding.
   Method: Using a qualitative case study methodology, this research
   examined Linkedln's public user profiles. One case study participant was
   selected, whose profile met the criteria of promoting personal branding
   via multiple media artifacts, using transmedia storytelling techniques,
   and networking inside a participatory social media culture.
   Results: In this case study, the participant, Jacobs, used multimodal
   composing and transmedia storytelling techniques on Linkedln's social
   media site. Sharing smaller narratives across different media, Jacobs
   invites participation from his followers as well as responses from him
   to his followers. Within this participatory culture, his posts often
   blur personal and professional topics of interest but still remain
   singularly focused on promoting his personal branding to a wider
   audience
   Conclusion: Young professionals are not turning to traditional resources
   for advice on how to establish personal branding. Instead, they are
   turning to a networked, social world and using multiple media and
   transmedia storytelling techniques to attract followers, connect to
   other professionals, and network with potential employers.},

Title = {The Transmedia Workbench: Technical Communication and User-Driven
   Innovation},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {244-256},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Emergent cultural and technological developments are actively
   involving users not just in how technology is understood and utilized
   but also in how it is produced and what its capabilities might be. From
   the perspective of technical communication, this direct involvement is
   enacted across networks of participatory media artifacts: webpages, user
   forums, tutorial videos, images, and open source software. In this
   article, I discuss how these transmedia networks support user-driven
   innovation and what roles technical communicators might play in
   creating, curating, and maintaining them. As a case study of a
   transmedia network, I examine the Werkstatt Workshop, the online user
   portal supporting Moog's Werkstatt synthesizer.
   Method: My case study employs discourse analytic techniques to show how
   the language of the Werkstatt Workshop is both descriptive and
   constitutive of an emergent social practice. To theorize roles for
   technical communicators, I draw on previous studies of user forums, open
   source software, and tactical technical communication.
   Results: Discourses circulating within the Werkstatt Workshop go beyond
   simply documenting system processes to construct a world in which
   network participants enact identities, form relationships, and
   reconfigure information across media boundaries. The open, participatory
   orientation of the network incentivizes information sharing and
   innovation, as users organize knowledge resources around a common set of
   technological problems.
   Conclusion: Emerging cultures of making and modifying present
   opportunities to technical communicators as content creators, network
   administrators, and critics, helping to construct, optimize, and
   seriously understand new, productive knowledge networks supporting
   user-centered production and innovation.},

Abstract = {Purpose: We present a proposal for HDITA, an HTML5-based version of the
   Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). We report on an
   exploratory study about the feasibility of using HDITA as an authoring
   platform for technical content. We asked how novice technical writers
   describe and evaluate the complexity and difficulty of the different
   stages of the HDITA authoring process and if novice technical writers
   can author effective topic-based technical content in HTML5 (HDITA)
   without full knowledge of XML (DITA).
   Method: To evaluate the feasibility of authoring and publishing with
   HDITA, we modified the Instructions assignment of an introductory
   college course called Technical Writing. Students wrote blog posts
   during the authoring process and completed a survey on the perceived
   difficulty of HDITA. We evaluated the quality of HDITA Web deliverables
   with college students from diverse technical and academic backgrounds.
   Results: Most author students were somewhat confident authoring
   technical content with HDITA, and most said they were very likely to
   somewhat likely to use HDITA in the future for technical writing
   projects. Students reported that the most difficult part of using HDITA
   involved Web templates and not HDITA itself. Twenty-seven students
   evaluated HDITA deliverables and gave them positive scores using a
   rubric for assessing quality technical information.
   Conclusion: Acknowledging the small number of student authors involved
   in this feasibility study, we can still conclude that novice technical
   writers did not perceive creating technical documentation with HDITA as
   difficult or highly complex. Most student evaluators were able to
   complete the assigned tasks following the instructions created in HDITA.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine the attitudes and perspectives of individuals in
   successful companies who manage technical communicators with a specific
   focus on the products and processes that make up the bulk of their work.
   Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we
   used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews.
   Results: This research helped to further explain the relationship
   between what technical communicators produce and how these products
   function in situating or framing their producers in relation to other
   subfields/related disciplines, such as UX design, information design,
   knowledge management, usability, and information architecture.
   Conclusion: While there is general agreement among the managers that the
   role of the technical communicator has to expand, there is no one clear
   agreed-upon strategy. Some companies are obtaining success using Agile
   methodology, while others are finding that this methodology, while
   stressing adaptability, is not easy to introduce. Corporate cultures do
   not change overnight. Still, integrated teams, a key component of Agile,
   are taking hold in most cultures. Equally important, the shift away from
   writing documents to directing content is well underway. The key now, as
   it has been for decades, is for technical communicators to highlight
   their value and make their contributions more visible.},

Title = {The Three Approaches to Professionalization in Technical Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Explores internal divisions within our profession by exploring
   one particular type of tension: that technical communicators do not have
   a unified view of professionalization for the field.
   Method: Proposes that prevailing approaches to professionalization are
   rooted in theories of occupations, the exclusive right to perform a job.
   True occupations have such rights legally; aspiring occupations like
   ours are disciplines. Common components of an infrastructure for
   occupations include professional organizations, bodies of knowledge,
   education, professional activities, and certification.
   Results: Disciplines often establish these in anticipation of becoming
   an occupation, but some practicing professionals interpret and use them
   differently, resulting in a spectrum of approaches to
   professionalization. At one end of the spectrum is formal
   professionalism, which views professionalization as a stepping stone to
   full occupational status. It is rooted in a worldview that values
   expertise and sees the infrastructure of an occupation supporting the
   development of expertise and controlling access to the profession. In
   the center of the spectrum is quasiprofessionalization, in which
   individuals participate in the activities of the occupational
   infrastructure but without the expectation of exclusive rights to
   perform the work. Quasiprofessionalization is rooted in professional
   identity. At the other end of the spectrum is contraprofessionalization,
   which refers to initiatives that offer or promote professional services
   outside of parts of or the entire infrastructure, sometimes
   circumventing it completely. This world view is rooted in market theory
   and characterized by concepts like do-it-yourself (DIY), user-generated,
   and subject matter expert (SME)-provided documentation.
   Conclusions: The differing views suggest tensions regarding support for
   specific efforts to professionalize technical communication, including
   formal branding of the profession, establishment of certification, and
   support for professional organizations.},

Title = {Color Matters: Color as Trustworthiness Cue in Web sites},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-160},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose: In today's increasingly technological world, the first
   impression of an orgnization is often based on a user's judgment of the
   corporate Web site's trustworthiness. This study investigates whether
   color as a Web site element can serve as a trustworthiness cue. In
   addition, the context of these Web sites was taken into account as
   research indicates that emotions associated with colors might differ
   between contexts.
   Method: An experimental study was conducted in which first impressions
   of trustworthiness of Web sites were measured in relation with the
   chosen color scheme. More than 200 participants evaluated eight finance,
   eight legal, and eight medical Web sites on perceived trustworthiness.
   Each respondent was presented with an identical Web site that only
   differed on the used color scheme. Four different color schemes (red,
   blue, green, and black) were put to the test.
   Result: The findings indicate that when the same Web site is presented
   using different color schemes, the Web sites are considered to have
   different levels of trustworthiness. Color has a statistically
   significant but limited effect, compared with all other reasons people
   can have to trust a Web site. Overall, the blue color scheme was
   perceived as most trustworthy and black as least trustworthy. The effect
   of the context is statistically significant, but very small.
   Conclusion: The color-trustworthiness relationship has never been
   demonstrated in the context of Web sites. This study supports the common
   sense idea with scientific evidence by showing that color matters in a
   user's judgment of a Web site's trustworthiness. Web site designers can
   increase the trustworthiness of a Web site by using an appropriate color
   scheme.},

Abstract = {Thanks to electronic communications technologies, interacting with
   individuals in other nations is often as easy as interacting with our
   next-door neighbors. This speed and ease of access has eroded
   traditional barriers of distance and has led to an interconnected global
   economy of unprecedented scale. These new levels of interaction and
   connection will undoubtedly affect individuals in all professions, and
   future success will certainly involve understanding and appreciating the
   status of key economic players. From a technical communication
   perspective, the People's Republic of China-more commonly referred to
   simply as China-is poised to become a major power in the international
   technical marketplace of this new century. Today's technical
   communicator should therefore examine how China could affect future
   trends in the field by looking at three key kinds of issues: economic,
   communication, and ethical/legal.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-95},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The goal of this article is to provide a tutorial for measuring
   the sustainability impacts of our content. Sustainability considerations
   should be just as important as the accessibility and usability of
   content. Fortunately, following our known best practices for effective
   content creation and governance also results in a smaller carbon
   footprint. This not only benefits the planet but also positions content
   creators as valuable business assets.Method: An extensive literature
   review led to the development of processes and guidelines that connect
   our existing best practices for content with a new paradigm for
   sustainable content.Results: This tutorial will examine five content
   scenarios and the relative impacts of each: modifications to individual
   web pages, content governance (removal of redundant, outdated, and
   trivial content), email blasts, videos, and podcasts. Metrics will be
   provided for justifying content decisions to management, and
   recommendations will be given for both optimizing usability and
   sustainability.Conclusion: Merging established best practices for
   content creation and curation with measurable energy-to-emissions data
   gives us powerful tools for justifying content choices and demonstrating
   measurable value to both the organization and the planet. Keywords:

Pages = {54-82},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Crowdfunding campaigns are a way to secure capital for
   organizations, entrepreneurs, artists, and more. Little research has
   focused on stylistic aspects of text associated with successful
   campaigns. Method: We used corpus analysis to analyze the text of
   312,529 Kickstarter campaigns. We used a novel scoring method to compute
   how often verbs and words surrounding verbs were associated with success
   or failure. We then identified prominent stylistic aspects of text that
   were often included in successful and unsuccessful campaigns. Results:
   Stylistic elements strongly associated with success included using we
   instead of I, using contractions instead of full forms of verbs,
   inviting the reader to join the project and receive rewards, and
   projecting confidence via will instead of the more uncertain would.
   Conclusion: Stylistic findings interact. Specifically, using we and
   contractions together indicates outcomes strongly associated with
   success. Broadly, each of the findings point toward creators of
   campaigns attempting to build trust in the readers. The elements of this
   emergent style work together toward a goal of producing campaign text
   that describes a campaign readers accept and trust as likely to succeed.},

Abstract = {Purpose: What can technical communicators learn from a seemingly swank
   event such as the Reddit Wall Street Bets and GameStop (WSB-GME) saga?
   In this article, we identify tactical organizing in online spaces as a
   complex convergence of social uptake and socialized information afforded
   by news sharing and mass user interactions in digital platforms.Methods:
   We employed a case study methodology that combined positivist and
   interpretive perspectives toward a developing event. We curated a series
   of Reddit posts pertaining to the WSB-GME saga and applied critical
   discourse analysis with a focus on the tactical and multimodal elements
   in these posts to identify their professional and theoretical
   implications.Results: We found the networked social mania to be driven
   by a discourse founded on a common goal and a shared leadership that
   emerges from vertical and horizontal community building. While
   technology assumes an agentive role in facilitating tactical efforts, it
   can also create an information bubble, where users may be gripped by a
   cult -like devotion for their heroes and desire to be part of the latest
   trends, thereby making risky financial bets.Conclusion: The WSB-GME saga
   illustrated implications for tactical technical communication as well as
   the impact of networked interactions on democratization of information,
   consumer engagement, and the rhetoric of finance.},

Title = {Uncommonly Common: Reconsidering Creativity and Beauty in Technical
   Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {28-48},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this article, we (re)consider the moments of creativity and
   beauty in the work of technical communication and how those moments can
   be better incorporated into, emphasized, explored, and engaged with in
   classroom instruction or other training.
   Method: We performed a literature review of texts published in the last
   25 years, identified by searching for the keywords ``creativity{''} and
   ``beauty{''} in technical communication journals, to understand how
   these concepts have been theorized and included in the field recently.
   We then extended this prior literature to consider how beauty and
   creativity might be incorporated into technical communication
   teaching/training. The suggestions offered are grounded in experiences,
   observations, and student feedback from our own classrooms and training,
   and/or from other classroom studies and additional literature from the
   field.
   Results: We identified creative approaches that help students and
   practitioners think more intentionally about audience, purpose, and
   visual elements in technical communication. These approaches reinforce
   (rather than distract from) established principles of technical
   communication. We offer practical solutions for instructors and trainers
   who are intrigued by more creative techniques but may, for various
   reasons, consider artistic elements inappropriate or unworkable in their
   classrooms.
   Conclusion: Fostering an appreciation for creative and beautiful
   communication in the classroom helps develop more effective technical
   communicators. Especially considering that the ways audiences encounter
   and interact with information have been changing rapidly, technical
   communicators must be able to think and create both visually and
   spatially, as well as connect with users on a human level.},

Title = {The Art of Visual Design: The Rhetoric of Aesthetics in Technical
   Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {6-27},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: By recognizing the importance of aesthetics, which have infused
   technical communication for centuries, designers can more effectively
   meet audience expectations and achieve key rhetorical goals, including
   heightening audience engagement, arousing emotion, and enhancing
   credibility and persuasiveness. Designers can integrate aesthetics into
   technical communications by deploying visual conventions generated by
   larger cultural forces, by applying design principles that foster
   beauty, and by inventing novel forms.
   Methods: Aesthetic theory, both ancient and modern, and insights from
   practitioners create a foundation for defining beauty; research and
   usability studies examining audience preferences provide empirical
   evidence about the functional value of aesthetics; and aesthetic
   developments in the nineteenth century and the subsequent shift to
   Modernism serve to illustrate the cultural influences on design. The
   Design Methods Movement affords a springboard for exploring the design
   process and the nature of creativity.
   Results: Although theorists and practitioners hold conflicting views on
   the role of aesthetics in functional design, many consider it an
   important factor that makes designs attractive and engaging to
   audiences. The pursuit of beauty continues today through the application
   of culturally based conventions and design principles associated with
   beauty.
   Conclusion: The cultural knowledge embedded in visual aesthetics
   operates silently, even imperceptibly, as technical communicators deploy
   aesthetic conventions to meet audience expectations and to streamline
   their design processes. At the same time, technical communicators need
   leeway for creativity and novelty as they adapt visual elements to
   specific rhetorical situations, often seeking audience feedback about
   their aesthetic preferences to create engaging, persuasive, and usable
   designs.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper analyzes the challenges confronted by existing
   content teams and proposes a future-state framework for orchestrating
   enterprise content services with a content intelligence program that
   spans disciplines and organizational silos. {[}A] proposes an
   organizational model to support content intelligence, that incorporates
   distinct Content Strategy, Content Engineering, and Content Operations
   practices within an overall Content Services Organization (CSO). To
   achieve an effective return on assets as part of an overall content
   strategy, enterprise content teams should build a unified management
   approach under a coherent Content Operating Model (COM).
   Method: Content engineers at {[}A], the content intelligence service,
   evaluated publishing team structures and workflows across large-scale
   enterprise publishers, including in-depth investigations at seven of the
   largest global companies.
   The approaches advocated in this article are a result of the {[}A]
   findings and resulting recommendations from these in-depth analyses.
   Results: New practices are necessary across the enterprise, established
   within a continuum between Content Strategy, Content Engineering and
   Content Operations. A collaborative strategy and set of standards must
   be organized across authoring groups.
   Conclusion: Directed by a new Global Content Operating Model (GCOM), a
   Content Services Organization (CSO), powered by the triumvirate of
   Content Strategy, Content Engineering and Content Operations, provides a
   balanced and effective path for large-scale publishing organizations to
   embrace the intelligence revolution.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study describes the specification, development,
   procurement, and implementation of two systems for managing
   business-critical technical data for a large multinational company.
   Method: This study uses a descriptive analytical method, based on
   available project data, interviews, and fault analyses.
   Results: The results of this research outline the technical, strategic,
   and organizational aspects that are associated with the development and
   procurement of two business-critical systems managing large publishing
   volumes, a variety of formats, and fast deployment of outputs.
   Conclusion: A system and function analysis of all products was critical
   for success; a high degree of terminological quality was of paramount
   importance; consistent writing and typesetting rules were required to
   maximize 100\% repetitions in the localization workflow; and a strong
   content management system (CMS) infrastructure was a defining factor for
   the second procurement and implementation.},

Title = {Incorporating Social Science, the Fine Arts, and Technical Writing: A
   Case History at Publishing Concepts (PCI)},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {72-89},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this article is to present a case history of one
   company's project to refine and define its core values statement. In
   this case, the company chose to employ both traditional technical
   communication technique and the fine arts of creative writing, graphic
   design, photography, and illustrating.
   Method: This article provides a detailed description of the process that
   one company employed to update an existing core values statement. It
   also provides the reader with specific guidance on the company's process
   including the use of social science tools and the inclusion of fine
   arts.
   Results: The results of this case history document the production of two
   specific cultural artifacts, a booklet and a book, which demonstrate the
   purpose and efficacy of using a combination of technical writing and the
   fine arts to produce artifacts that both convey meaning in a technical
   sense and evoke emotion in an aesthetic sense.
   Conclusion: The intentional use of the fine arts can help a company
   create a core values statement that becomes an important cultural
   artifact and can help employees not just understand their role in that
   business but to also see how they are valued as part of it. Technical
   writing faculty should encourage students to incorporate creativity, and
   technical writing practitioners can use the artifacts developed in this
   case study as examples of work that can be produced through the
   intersection of the fine arts and technical communication.},

Title = {A One-Hundred Forty Character Discourse: The Twitter Apology as an
   Emerging Sub-Genre of Corporate Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-30},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: In the emerging world of social media, social media platforms
   have offered a number of marketing opportunities but also a number of
   potential problems. This has led to a number of social media foibles
   that can create a public relations nightmare for the affected companies.
   This article will explore the emerging phenomenon of the corporate
   Twitter apology and the rhetorical constructs that are required for an
   effective apology.
   Method: Using the strategies of Ruth Page and John Kador, I have
   analyzed successful and unsuccessful Twitter apologies. The success of
   these apologies is determined by the public response from the tertiary
   audiences comprised of Twitter followers.
   Results: This study determined that successful Twitter apologies use a
   combination of Kador's strategies (Recognition, Responsibility, Remorse,
   Restitution, and Repetition), originally implemented for analog
   apologies, adapted for electronic communications to make a successful
   social media apology.
   Conclusion: Surviving any serious social media foible depends upon
   issuing a successful apology and doing so on the social media platform
   where the original offense took place. Social media mistakes, though
   unique in their scope and potential to reach an ever-expanding tertiary
   audience, can be managed using the same strategies that apply to analog
   apologies.},

Title = {The Burden of Ambiguity: Writing at a Cooperative},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-45},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: While many organizations use ambiguity to strategically build a
   ``unified diversity{''} around an organization's mission, democratically
   managed organizations need to tread a narrow path between necessary
   ambiguity (which allows flexibility) and dysfunctional ambiguity (which
   causes disarray). To illustrate, I report a subset of findings regarding
   occasions when ambiguous documents had a significant impact on a
   democratically managed organization.
   Methods: I conducted a three-phase study of a democratic cooperative.
   Using a mixed-methods approach, I sought to uncover the ways technical
   and professional communication (TPC) concerns like ambiguity and clarity
   function in a democratic business. In my analysis, I looked for patterns
   and dissonance between/among artifacts and participants, paying special
   attention to areas of ambiguity. Interviews and transcripts were
   analyzed alongside various genres using rhetorical analysis.
   Results: Looking at two significant documents-job descriptions and
   bylaws-I found that ambiguity was rarely benign at Owen's House. In the
   job descriptions, ambiguity rendered key positions dysfunctional and
   undermined the collective, resulting in a crisis. However, ambiguity in
   the bylaws allowed the collective to reinterpret organizational goals in
   support of necessary changes critical to achieving solvency.
   Conclusion: When building unified diversity, democratic organizations
   must consider the positive and negative consequences of textual
   ambiguity. This consideration should extend to regulatory documents
   where clarity is often an assumed objective. Documents need to be
   flexible enough to adapt to changes and defined enough to avoid sliding
   into dysfunction.},

Title = {How to Better Prepare Technical Communication Students in an Evolving
   Field: Perspectives from Academic Program Directors, Practitioners, and
   Recent Graduates},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {67},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this article is to address the changing identity
   of the technical communication (TC) field based on how it's defined,
   what hard and soft skills are needed, what courses are beneficial, and
   how to best prepare students for the evolving workplace.
   Method: We interviewed 15 technical communicators in three different
   categories (academic program directors, practitioners, and recent
   graduates) and analyzed the interviews to determine if technical
   communicators have similar perspectives about the field.
   Results: Findings showed inconsistencies among the definition of TC, the
   required skills for students entering the workplace, the field's
   outlook, the value of professional development, the courses, and
   requirements of academic programs in TC.
   Conclusion: The hybrid perspectives on these important questions
   challenge the framework for how we have traditionally considered these
   questions. This study provides additional context into how the academic
   field sees TC, how practitioners see it, and whether or not students are
   prepared for the workforce after graduation based on the coursework they
   have completed and the skills they have gained.},

Title = {Visualizing a Non-Pandemic: Considerations for Communicating Public
   Health Risks in Intercultural Contexts},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {244-257},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Report the results of a rhetorical analysis that examines the
   ways that data visualizations of epidemic disease influence risk
   perception in global contexts, propose strategies that technical
   communicators can draw from when constructing data visualizations for
   intercultural audiences in crisis and emergency risk scenarios, and
   discuss implications for technical communication practice.
   Method: Rhetorical analysis of four select infographics created by the
   New York Times to communicate Ebola risk during the outbreak that began
   in West Africa in 2014 using the following facets associated with design
   in global contexts: use of warm and cool colors, high versus
   low-context, and collectivism versus individualism.
   Results: Data visualizations dramatically shape how risks are perceived.
   Language-based content may communicate one message about risk, while the
   visual strategies used in data visualizations may communicate a very
   different message. Rather than emphasizing control over the outbreak, I
   argue that the visual message in the infographics in this analysis
   communicates the opposite. Maps show Ebola breaching national (Figures 1
   and 4) and international borders (Figure 2), and line graphs (Figure 3)
   show sharp increases in cases and deaths in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
   Conclusion: Warm colors increase risk perception. Further, data
   visualizations are high-context, collectivistic forms of visual
   communication, which lessen risk perception among experts but intensify
   risk perception among nonexperts. Technical communicators can draw from
   the following guidelines when constructing data visualizations that
   communicate risk for intercultural audiences: show quantitative
   information using a variety of visualization strategies, include
   explanatory text and/or visuals to more fully contextualize data
   visualizations, and add comparative data visualizations.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {69},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article explores the role of technical communicators
   during disaster response and provides suggestions to practitioners about
   how to incorporate social justice-oriented language, culture, and
   context-specific crisis communication during disasters. Method: This is
   a mixed-methods study that includes a) narrative inquiry and b) social
   network analysis. The study is based on two different disasters: the
   April 2015 Nepal Earthquake and Hurricane Maria of 2017. I used
   narrative inquiry with 28 participants who represented government,
   non-governmental agencies, community organizers, activists, and students
   for the qualitative study portion of my research. For the social network
   analysis portion, I analyzed approximately 50 million tweets that were
   posted during the first week after both disasters. In this article, I
   showcased a word frequency display that focuses on the words uttered and
   written in response to the calamities. Results: Based on this method, I
   found that there were two different types of communication that happened
   during these two disasters: organizational communication and crisis
   publics communication, which was mediated by people from all walks of
   life. Conclusion: Technical communicators and publics (local or
   non-experts) who take up the role of technical communicators during a
   disaster can play an important role in providing accurate information
   and dispelling misinformation by working closely with the experts,
   scientists, journalists, and other officials.},

Title = {Developing Technical Videos: Genres (or ``Templates{''}) for Video
   Planning, Storyboarding, Scriptwriting, and Production},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {56-75},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical video production in technical communication courses
   and practice have become increasingly prevalent with wider access to
   video equipment, software, and distribution technologies. The goal of
   this article is to provide a tutorial covering the writing genres used
   to develop well-planned informative, instructional, or persuasive
   videos.
   Method: The process and genres in this article are developed from a
   comprehensive literature review as well as eight years of course
   development teaching advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on
   ``technical video.{''}
   Results: In this article, four genres for technical video planning and
   production are characterized, with examples, for industry practitioners,
   students, and instructors: video project proposal, storyboard, script,
   and shot list.
   Conclusion: The four-genres used to develop technical videos in industry
   begins with video project proposal specifying the content, video style,
   delivery mode of the video, budget, and project timeline. The second
   step is to create a storyboard, a scene-by-scene sequence of drawings
   detailing the story or information planned for the video. Next, the
   process of writing the script develops from the storyboard outline to a
   more detailed visual and narrated script that emphasizes both the
   content and style. As covered in the article, video scriptwriting
   differs from other forms of technical writing-somewhat more similar to
   an oral presentation rather than print documentation. Furthermore, the
   narration of technical videos is more complex and often subordinate to
   the dynamic visual communication (which is, optimally, the primary mode
   of communicating information to the audience). Finally, the fourth genre
   to consider is the shot list, which takes the content directly from the
   script and reorganizes scenes and shots by location for the production
   staff in order to streamline the filming stage.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the usability of chatbot design and how chatbots
   and search compare for information delivery and usability, we ran two
   test cases. In the first, we focused only on chatbot usability,
   information delivery, and design. In the second, we compared chatbot
   responses to those provided by search engines to identify areas of
   similarities and differences in terms of accuracy, functionality, and
   usability.
   Method: Test Case 1 uses an exploratory method to analyze chatbot
   functionality. Test Case 2 uses content analysis of search responses and
   corresponding chatbot responses. Data from two major telecommunication
   companies' websites-Sprint and Verizon-was used for both. Results: In
   Test Case 1, we found that chatbots are generally more flexible and
   helpful when they provide information directly in the chat pane and
   allow free-form text entry, in addition to several other related
   characteristics. This was critical to receiving the information we
   needed efficiently and accurately.
   Results of Test Case 2 show that chatbots provide less information than
   search results, have longer wait times, and rely less on algorithms to
   get responses and more on constant updating.
   Conclusion: Based on Test Case 1, we developed a heuristic that
   addresses usability, information design, and accessibility. In Test Case
   2, we determined that search functionality is better than that of
   chatbots in terms of 1) speed of response, 2) accuracy of responses, 3)
   multiple formats for content delivery, and 4) ease of use and
   accessibility.},

   Alignment within Technical Communication Forums},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {314-327},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical communication research should link the academy to
   industry and sustain both with a foundation for solving problems and
   identifying new areas of inquiry. However, the publication needs and
   motivations of academics and practitioners have resulted in content
   alignment issues so divergent that it oftentimes appears that both
   parties are from different planets.
   Method: We empirically analyzed the content within 1,048 published
   articles over a 20-year period within core professional and academic
   forums. We coded the articles for variables related to topic and
   audience. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and
   correspondence analysis.
   Results: Our field's core content forums have evolved little over the
   last 27 years. Results also indicated distinct differences in article
   topics and audience that reflect the varying interests of academics and
   practitioners. Intercom and Technical Communication Quarterly emerged as
   the most defined forums.
   Conclusion: The incongruity within professional and academic articles
   further suggests that we are a fragmented discipline. We recommend that
   our current content forums adopt structured abstracts and implications
   statements to unify our research and that researchers seek alternative
   audiences for their scholarship. We also call on practitioners to
   strengthen their involvement in research, either by contributing to
   scholarship or by volunteering their organizations as research sites.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {258-270},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: The goal of this article is two-fold:
   It argues technical communicators can challenge current models and/or
   approaches of how to design materials for international audiences.
   It explains how technical communicators might consider using a technique
   offered by a mobile application called App Abroad to document
   commonplace cultural interactions to support reflection from users from
   different cultures.
   Methods: The article draws from technical communication theory and
   practice to explain a bottom-up method of designing effective materials
   for international audiences.
   Results: By creating opportunities to document cultural encounters
   through media that can convey the complexity of face-to-face
   communication, readers learn to seek a more bottom-up approach to
   understanding culture.
   Conclusion: Because culture is not static but constantly transforming,
   technical communicators must challenge traditional models that seek to
   address culture from the perspective of a single, national cultural
   identity. Rather, a more ``bottom-up{''} (that is, not predetermined)
   understanding of cultural communication practices is needed to help
   technical communicators create more effective materials for
   international users. A bottom-up understanding of culture can support
   improved intercultural technical communication outcomes.},

Title = {A Constructionist English Language Teaching Project Based on an

Abstract = {Purpose: This article presents and evaluates an educational project
   designed to simulate a professional workplace environment for tertiary
   aeronautical engineering students. Students had the options of working
   with engineering-related software or choosing a theoretical topic for an
   undergraduate English language project.
   Method: This practitioner case-study research is based on a
   mixed-methods approach. Students were asked to complete a quantitative
   evaluation survey, which was complemented by an analysis of students'
   project reports, presentations and the teacher's supervision log. The
   final reports functioned as both an assignment for marking and an
   evaluation of the project results.
   Results: In total, 14 out of 20 students returned an evaluation survey
   sheet. Based on the mean group rankings of statements on a five-point
   Likert scale (0 to 4 points), the results showed that students perceived
   several objectives as greatly achieved: expanding subject-specific
   vocabulary (3.35), working with scientific literature (3.21), following
   a given template for writing scientific texts (3.21), and practicing
   techniques of literature search (3.07). Furthermore, students found it
   very important that they could exercise autonomy during the project
   phase (3.78) and had been allowed free choice of the project topic
   (3.64). The five project groups submitted reports of generally good
   linguistic quality on different aeronautical subject areas.
   Conclusion: As it may be concluded from the questionnaire responses,
   students favored language learning through collaborative constructionist
   project activity and learner autonomy. A didactic framework that
   promotes these elements seems to be well suited for similar technical
   learning environments, although no direct generalizations can be made
   from this small-scale case study.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To offer additional tools for the assessment of effectiveness
   and usability in technology-mediated communication based in established
   heuristics.
   Method: An interdisciplinary group of researchers at Rensselaer
   Polytechnic Institute selected five disparate examples of
   technology-mediated communication, formally evaluated each using
   contemporary heuristics, and then engaged in an iterative design process
   to arrive at an expanded toolkit for in depth analyses.
   Results: A set of heuristics and operationalized metrics for the deeper
   analysis of a broader scope of contemporary technology-mediated
   communication.
   Conclusions: The continual evolution of communication, including the
   emergence of new, interactive media, provides a challenging opportunity
   to identify effective approaches and techniques. There are benefits to a
   renewed focus on relationships between people and between people and
   information, and we offer additional criteria and metrics to supplement
   established means of heuristic analysis.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},

Pages = {45-64},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This paper updates Harner \& Rich's 2005 survey of
   undergraduate degree programs in technical and professional
   communication (TPC) in the U. S. and provides information about the
   current number of degree programs, locations of degrees programs, and
   curricula, both required and elective.
   Method: We used course catalogs to analyze the curricula of 65 programs
   that offer majors in TPC. We employed qualitative inquiry methods based
   primarily on textual analysis and the deployment of codes to assign a
   summative attribute for course types.
   Results: We located 185 undergraduate programs in TPC in the U. S. that
   offer majors, concentrations, emphases, tracks, and specialization, a
   131\% increase from the 2005 study, and restricted our analysis to 65
   programs that offered majors in TPC. Degree programs no longer are
   predominately housed in English departments. The most significant gain
   is to the number of programs housed in Technical Communication Programs.
   The majority of programs require 30-36 hours of credit. A set of ``core
   courses{''} are emerging in the field-wide curricula. There is a
   significant increase in the number of programs requiring
   document/information design, Web, internship, and capstone courses. In
   contrast, few require literature courses.
   Conclusion: Curricular data show an emerging consensus on the core
   courses and elective courses within undergraduate curricula. In
   addition, for the first time, the field has data to assess trends over
   time.},

   Design Conventions},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {302-323},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Research on Web design conventions has an almost exclusive
   focus on Web design for adults. There is far less knowledge about Web
   design for children. For the first time, an overview is presented of the
   current design conventions for children's informational Web sites.
   Method: In this study a large corpus of 100 children's international,
   informational Web sites from four different domains (science, pets,
   arts, and health) is analyzed. The instrument for analyzing the Web
   sites included categories on visual design, navigation and information
   architecture.
   Results: The design conventions identified in this study show that
   designers of children's informational Web sites often follow general Web
   design guidelines. This study also shows that there is still much
   confusion about how to design Web sites for children. A closer look at
   the data revealed three categories of informational Web sites especially
   designed for children, diverging from a classical to a playful design
   approach.
   Conclusion: An overview is presented of the current design conventions
   for children's informational Web sites. The identified design
   conventions should be further tested and validated as design standards
   for children's informational Web design. Further, the design of
   children's informational Web sites is determined by two dimensions of
   aesthetics; classical and expressive. In this study, expressive
   aesthetics results in playful visual design or in a total playful
   interaction design. The effects of playful design on children's affect
   and cognition will be an important topic in future research on
   children's digital search behavior.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article explores how marketing communication in
   traditional media and new media leads people to the Web sites of
   technical communication companies, consultants, and independent
   contractors, and to what extent these Web sites then contribute to
   recruiting clientele.
   Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 technical
   communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services, and then
   interviewed half of these survey respondents.
   Results: Aside from drawing in a moderate portion of clientele directly,
   these Web sites also helped recruit clientele who originated through
   such traditional marketing communication as referrals and networking.
   Yet such traditional communication tended not to be as useful in leading
   people to these sites as new-media communication, such as search engines
   and e-mail. Marketing communication's usefulness in leading people to a
   Web site is associated with that Web site's levels of success in
   recruiting clientele.
   Conclusion: A Web site's efficacy may thereby depend in part on the
   support of other communication, especially communication sharing a
   similar medium.},

Title = {Requirements Specifications and Anticipating User Needs: Methods and
   Warnings on Writing Development Narratives for New Software},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-43},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article studies and determines the benefits for technical
   communicators using narrative to compose and edit software requirements
   specifications. Specifically, this article is an examination of
   requirements specifications written for a Web-based radiology
   application serving the medical industry.
   Method: The study adheres to the usability principle that successful
   design accommodates complex problem solving. Requirements
   specifications, the application, and the application's code are examined
   as part of the study.
   Results: The first determination is that composing detailed narratives
   within the requirements specifications can ensure flexible spaces for
   users, in this case doctors, to view, study, and manipulate data as they
   see fit. The article also acknowledges and accounts for the reality of
   low-level or code-level procedural programming required for creating
   such flexible spaces. The second determination is that employing
   narratological structures within requirements specifications also leads
   to technical inventions at the code level. Practitioners will have a
   better understanding of how their work facilitates the development of a
   software application's functionality, design, and even code.
   Conclusion: Ultimately, narrative is the suggested method for developing
   the flexible affordances desired by usability specialists and it
   simultaneously helps negotiate low-level code.},

Title = {Embodied Personas for a Mobile World},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Personas have long been an important tool for technical
   communicators to use to understand audiences. However, a recent critique
   of personas questioned their usefulness as a tool for audience analysis.
   This article takes that question as the starting point to offer a
   re-conceptualization of persona creation.
   Method: A comprehensive review of the literature with a case study as an
   extended example provides insights into the necessity of updating update
   how technical communicators create personas.
   Results: The literature review exposes major gaps in the research about
   persona development that, when compared to the case study, shows the
   need for technical communicators to update the dimensions of how
   personas are created and to reclaim the emphasis on goals and purposes
   of the user's practice.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators need to re-conceptualize the
   creation of personas by incorporating additional dimensions that create
   embodied personas for a mobile world and that reclaim and refocus the
   persona's emphasis on goals and purposes rather than simply a focus on
   audience. These changes allow technical communicators to meet the needs
   of users of complex information systems and, thereby, to contribute more
   meaningfully to user experience projects.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to explore the current state of
   technical communication in Finland, with a look into the future of the
   field as practitioners see it. This article is part of a larger study
   investigating technical communication through activity theory.
   Method: The study utilizes autoethnographic interview data to explore
   and analyze some of the issues technical communicators are currently
   facing, and how these issues affect their expectations for the future.
   The literature of the field is used to further illustrate the points
   made.
   Results: User-centeredness is widely recognized as one of the main
   quality factors in technical communication, but the current work
   processes of the field do not allow technical communicators access to
   users or user data. The interviewees are not satisfied with their
   current work conditions and fear for the future of the field.
   Conclusion: It is discovered that while we are currently facing serious
   problems, there is still a need for user advocates in the product
   development process. A new model for technical communication is needed
   in order for the field to survive.},

Title = {Community-Driven Information Quality Standards: How IBM Developed and
   Implemented Standards for Information Quality},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {307-315},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Standards for information quality can help content developers
   within a company or enterprise create high-quality, high-value content,
   as well as an excellent user experience for its clients. This article
   explains how the content development community at IBM created meaningful
   standards, as well as the metrics to track their impact, as part of a
   closed-loop information quality process.
   Method: Instead of having one group dictate what the standards will be,
   the content developers at IBM worked together as a community to identify
   key requirements from internal and external sources, tested the
   standards with a set of key products, and then put the standards to use
   in increasingly larger numbers of products.
   Results: A community-driven approach to information quality standards
   allowed the IBM content developers to create standards that were
   meaningful to a variety of teams, ensuring that key aspects of
   information quality were addressed throughout the corporation. The use
   of metrics to track implementation and compliance allowed the IBM
   community to see when the standards were working, and when the standards
   needed to be updated to meet the changing needs of their clients.
   Conclusions: Implementing information quality standards is an admirable
   goal, but it should not be the end of a company's information quality
   journey. This should be considered a closed loop or wheel, with
   continual analysis of compliance data, client feedback, and other
   metrics driving continual improvements in information quality.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine how blogs reflect practitioner views of
   professionalization topics (such as education, professional societies,
   and value and status).
   Methods: Content analysis of 10 practitioner blogs, focusing on
   professional topics of status, education, professional societies, and
   the effects of technology.
   Results: Although the bloggers under study appear to function as an
   effective community of practice, they are not currently directing their
   actions or attention toward the traditional goals of
   professionalization, such as licensing and accreditation.
   Conclusions: The latent themes that emerge show that many of the goals
   of professionalizing (such as standardizing routes into the field and
   increasing respect for the work) are also concerns of practitioners.},

Title = {Building a Playground: General Guidelines for Creating Educational Web
   Sites for Children},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {398-415},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Since 2004, the number of children online has increased 18\%,
   compared with a 10\% increase in total users. Not only do children
   represent a growing segment of Internet users, much of what they do
   online has a specific purpose: education. To help technical
   communicators create educational Web sites for children, we offer a set
   of guidelines to direct the design process.
   Method: Nine children participated in a usability test of the CARES
   Playground, an educational Web site geared toward 7- to 9-year-olds. The
   site was designed by a group of graduate students in professional
   writing based on a review of the (admittedly limited) literature dealing
   with designing Web sites for children. This paper matches common themes
   from existing literature to the results of the usability tests.
   Results: Since all the information on designing Web sites for children
   emerged from the literature of designing Web sites for adults, the
   themes of navigation, appearance, and content are not unfamiliar.
   However, the interpretation of those common issues for children-as well
   as the children's reaction to them-may be surprising.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be conscious and deliberate
   when designing Web sites for children. To ensure that educational Web
   sites are able to meet their learning goals, careful consideration of
   children's developmental abilities and Web preferences must be
   considered. We present several guidelines as a starting point, though
   further research is needed to confirm and expand upon them.},

Title = {Visual Translation, Design, and Language Justice: A Case Study from
   North Central Florida},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-21},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article presents a case study of how a bilingual technical
   communicator and a bilingual visual designer collaborated to visualize
   stories of language access in North Central Florida. Method: We combined
   participatory methods used in technical communication (Agboka, 2013;
   Rose and Cardinal, 2018) with interviews and design methods (Gonzalez
   Viveros et al., 2020) from both technical communication and visual
   design. The goal of the study was to document the languages spoken by
   immigrant community members in North Central Florida, to interview
   immigrant community members about their languages, and to transform
   interview data into visual designs that could inspire conversation about
   language justice in our community.Results: By transforming interview
   data into visual designs (i.e., collages), we were able to understand
   the complexity that language plays in the lives of multilingual
   communities, gaining insights into both the challenges and the
   advantages of speaking multiple languages as immigrants in North Central
   Florida.Conclusion: We encourage other technical communication and
   design researchers to implement visual data approaches in their work,
   particularly when working with participants whose language histories
   span beyond white American Englishes. As technical communication
   continues expanding into more global contexts and as language diversity
   continues to be a reality in contemporary technical communication work,
   interdisciplinary collaborations among technical communicators,
   translators, and designers, will continue to gain importance and impact,
   particularly in community -driven projects.},

   Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-40},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The communication of technical information is often susceptible
   to cognitive biases. Technical communicators need to understand
   cognitive biases , know how to tackle them accordingly. This article
   devises a framework of principles that provides technical communicators
   an operable affordance and a vocabulary to approach cognitive biases and
   to communicate empathetically. Method: I review a vast body of
   literature in technical communication with a focus on problems caused by
   cognitive biases. This work reveals significant problems in information
   visualization that can provide for a nuanced discussion on cognitive
   biases in technical communication. Using these problems as a guide, I
   draw upon cognitive theories in how people use information, the prospect
   theory about how people make decisions , the self-determination theory
   about how such decisions are influenced by the social context. I then
   assemble a framework of principles that illuminates the workings of
   cognitive biases. I extrapolate sample questions that technical
   communicators can use to examine cognitive biases in information
   visualization and technical communication.Results: The framework of
   principles explains how cognitive biases affect technical communication.
   These principles are useful for gaining a deeper understanding of users
   from a cognitive bias perspective and optimizing for empathetic
   communication. Conclusion: Technical communicators and users are prone
   to cognitive biases. The framework of principles, cognitive biases, and
   sample questions presented in this article provide technical
   communicators a new lens to examine their work and improve user
   experience.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {49-71},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: While many industry professionals, including user-experience
   designers, create personas to represent their target users, debate still
   exists about whether personas really help organizations improve
   user-centered attitudes and product design. This study tested whether
   personas increase performance and empathy on a creativity task.
   Method: 172 participants completed a creativity task in which they were
   given seven minutes to draw a space alien. Participants drew aliens
   either for themselves, an unspecified author, or an author represented
   by a persona. Participants also completed a survey collecting their
   attitudes about the activity and alien drawings. Four coders then used a
   five-item rubric to evaluate the creativity of each drawing.
   Results: There were no differences in creativity scores for the alien
   drawings between the persona, self, and other author groups. However,
   people drawing for themselves and the persona author were more confident
   in their alien drawings and more willing to share them. Within the
   persona group, those participants who reported thinking about the
   persona while drawing had more positive feelings about the drawing and
   the author who would use it.
   Conclusion: While the persona did not result in more creative drawings,
   personas may increase confidence and user-centered attitudes among
   designers when actively used.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This project examined the strategies elections technology
   companies use to establish ethos to clients and stakeholders and
   suggests implications these strategies have on the constitutional
   discourse about voting.
   Method: To manage the scope of the analysis, this project rhetorically
   analyzes three elections technology companies' ``About{''} pages. These
   ``About{''} pages are the heart of a company's digital ethos because
   they describe the mission, scope, history, and expertise of the company
   to its clients, customers, investors, and the public at large.
   Results: In addition to expected appeals to expertise, patriotism, and
   democratic values, these companies also created ethos through business
   profitability and the impartialness of technology to promote their
   products and democracy as a whole.
   Conclusion: An important part of building ethos among elections
   technology companies is done by appealing to business profitability and
   the impartiality of technology to promote democratic institutions. This
   contemporary strategy might reorient democratic discourse, values, and
   institutions themselves.},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Purpose: As a part of a clinic transformation project, we studied
   workflow processes in a family health center in order to recommend
   interventions for a team-based approach to patient care.
   Method: We conducted a needs analysis informed by Spinuzzi's (2013)
   Topsight, undertaken through over twenty hours of clinical observation,
   studying clinical communication practices by role in the clinic
   (provider, nurse, medical assistant, and front desk receptionist).
   Results: Delivering quality care that extends beyond the patient
   encounter (the face-to-face appointment) takes a highly coordinated
   team. Although the Center's schedule was set up for teams, the work
   environment was not well coordinated except where individual providers
   were more team-oriented.
   Conclusion: An Agile team approach to communicating may be an effective
   intervention for primary care clinics. Researchers in TPC and UX can
   usefully contribute to these kinds of inquiry projects in clinical
   settings, as our research methods offer viewpoints not visible to
   clinicians alone.},

Title = {East Meets West on Flat Design: Convergence and Divergence in Chinese
   and American User Interface Design},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-247},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study is designed to examine two design approaches:
   skeuomorphism and flat design, in both American and Chinese contexts.
   Questions explored include, What underlines this new design trend in
   American vs. Chinese cultures? How has this new design emerged? How will
   it evolve in the future? What culturally, underwritten aesthetic and
   rhetorical principles are at play?
   Method: Samples of user interface (UI) design are collected from both
   cultures and examined to compare similarities and differences wherever
   possible. In-depth textual analysis is used to deconstruct particular
   design cases.
   Results: Our analysis indicates that while flat design is the new trend,
   skeuomorphism has its place in UI design; each design has its advantages
   and shortcomings; and effective design may require the integration of
   both approaches. Our study also reveals that designs are culturally
   sensitive and that each particular design is contextualized and
   rhetorical. Flat design's popularity in the Chinese context has its
   unique rationale due to social, ideological, cultural, and linguistic
   reasons.
   Conclusion: Savvy designers combine professional taste and culturally
   sensitive perspectives to produce effective designs that work for their
   particular contexts.},

Abstract = {Purpose: There is a tremendous growth in the production of instructional
   videos. This study investigates whether popular YouTube instructional
   videos for declarative knowledge development differ in their physical
   characteristics from unpopular and average ones.
   Method: Sampling followed a three-step procedure. First, 250 YouTube
   videos aiming for declarative knowledge development were selected. Next,
   a formula for popularity rating was developed. After distinguishing
   three classes of popularity, the five most viewed videos for five types
   of declarative knowledge were selected. This resulted in a sample of 75
   videos. After coding and scoring, statistical analyses were performed to
   discover differences between popularity classes in the physical
   characteristics of videos.
   Results: Popular videos differed significantly from unpopular and/or
   average videos in the following ways: (1) higher production quality
   (that is, resolution); (2) more frequent presence of static pictures
   (both iconic and analytic); (3) more frequent presence of a combination
   of static and dynamic pictures; (4) more often short on-screen texts;
   (5) more often subtitling with different languages; (6) more frequent
   inclusion of background music; (7) less background noise; (8) faster
   speaking rate (that is, words per minute).
   Conclusion: The sampled videos strongly varied in their physical
   characteristics. There were also many significant differences across
   popularity classes. The findings can be used to optimize video designs
   for popularity. In addition, they provide a starting point for further
   research on how physical characteristics may affect knowledge
   development.},

Title = {Designing and Implementing a Low-Cost Usability Testing Laboratory:
   Theoretical Justifications and Practical Considerations},

Abstract = {Purpose: To share advice about how to create a low-cost usability
   testing lab based on the results of a year-long process of acquiring
   funding for a lab that supports Angelo State University's faculty,
   staff, and students.
   Methods: Literature review of usability testing labs, trends, and
   theories; a case study of designing and implementing a usability lab.
   Results: While there are numerous descriptions and justifications for
   labs in usability textbooks (Barnum, 2011; Rubin \& Chisnell, 2008), Web
   sites (Nielsen, 1994), and articles (Potosnak, 1990; Blatt et al.,
   1994), changes in usability technology and decreasing prices allows for
   the development of new, cost-efficient laboratories in locations that
   have historically not contained labs, such as small university campuses.
   This article shares how Angelo State University created an up-to-date,
   personalized, on-campus lab based on past and contemporary trends in
   usability testing.
   Conclusions: A usability lab on a university campus is possible to
   build, even with limited funding. Moreover, a step-by-step guide reveals
   that there are 1) strong theoretical reasons for constructing a
   usability lab, and 2) practical solutions for how to implement a design.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine the elements of professional consciousness in
   technical communication to facilitate the growth of professional
   identity.
   Method: To develop a structured collaboration model based on Wenger's
   three dimensions for establishing a community of practice: joint
   enterprise, mutual engagement, and shared repertoire.
   Results: Structured collaboration shows strong potential to nurture a
   community in which the specific professional identity of being an
   academic or a practitioner is minimized in favor of the negotiated
   identity of being a community member working toward mutual goals.
   Conclusions: Effective collaboration between the academic and
   practitioner communities creates a negotiated professionalism through
   better research, better education, and a more comprehensive body of
   knowledge. Structured collaboration along the lines of community of
   practice can be used to encourage professional consciousness, which can
   lead to professional status.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The case studies in this article look at user experience issues
   surrounding authorized and unauthorized media distribution, describing
   how researchers and practitioners can trace these experiences to learn
   how to empower social media participants rather than criminalize them.
   Method: By using Actor Network Theory (ANT) to look specifically at
   instances involving digital rights management (DRM) issues in the United
   States and the European Union, we can discover how content distribution
   is as much an issue of protecting intellectual property as it is a
   critical concern for usability.
   Results: Amazon's response to the removal of Orwell's books, Hulu's
   expiration of content, and Pandora's copyright restrictions cause
   numerous issues for consumers attempting to access this content legally.
   Conclusion: As communicators, legal experts, and international policy
   contributors, it is imperative that we design for these experiences,
   rather than over and around them. Looking across these
   networks-documenting what technologies, organizations, and people are
   involved-we can create a better map of what is or will be affected by
   any further implementation of law or technology. By participating in
   spaces typically thought of as the realm of legal scholars, policy
   makers, and lawyers, technical communicators can be stronger user
   advocates for the participants of these systems.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This research is the first step in exploring how public
   policymakers use the expert knowledge and nonexpert knowledge they
   acquire in oversight hearings. This step is focused on learning what the
   testimony in oversight hearings reveals about how the primary
   stakeholders of the February 2021 power loss event understood that
   event.
   Method: The researcher used NVivo, a content analysis application, to
   examine public comments, witness testimony, and a combination of
   legislators' press releases and the text of bills they drafted. All
   texts were generated in February and March 2021. The researcher ran both
   a word frequency analysis and a thematic analysis of each set of texts
   to identify topoi used by each stakeholder group and compared the
   results.
   Results: The analysis revealed that the three primary stakeholder groups
   perceived the February 2021 power loss event differently, though some of
   the most salient, significant, or urgent concerns of each group
   overlapped. The stakeholder groups shared some topoi, but the ways each
   group used those topoi suggested different ways of understanding and
   interpreting the event.
   Conclusions: Technical communicators who are tasked with reconciling
   technical and nontechnical audiences in situations like this can use the
   techniques discussed here to better identify specific places where the
   respective groups' use of topoi diverged from one another or aligned
   with one another. The more that is known, and not just surmised, about
   stakeholders and how they understand and interpret their technical
   knowledge, the better we can address how that knowledge may be
   communicated throughout the legislative process.},

Abstract = {Purpose: My goal was to determine whether the U.S. Navy's ``Don't Be a
   Dilbert{''} aviation safety campaign during World War II was a fully
   developed example of transmedia storytelling and whether it could be
   used as an illustration of transmedia storytelling in technical
   communication.
   Method: I located and gathered primary sources in the Navy's safety
   campaign from archives, museums, and military and civilian publications,
   and then analyzed these artifacts according to the definition and
   attributes of transmedia storytelling in Jenkins (2007, 2011).
   Results: From my analysis, I found that the Navy's use of the Dilbert
   myth combined multimodality with radical intertextuality in order to
   foster additive comprehension; it also employed a robust set of
   transmedia storytelling techniques.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that transmedia storytelling was used
   to communicate technical information before the digital age and that the
   Navy's Dilbert campaign is a potentially useful historical example for
   illustrating transmedia storytelling techniques.},

Title = {Technologies of Disenfranchisement: Literacy Tests and Black Voters in
   the US from 1890 to 1965},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Purpose: Largely due to the latest presidential election in the U.S.,
   voting interference and voting technologies have come to the fore of
   national debates. However, deploying technologies (broadly defined) as a
   way of interfering with voter rights is not a new phenomenon.
   Methods: In this study, we identified and located historical literacy
   tests (along with other related texts) that were used to disenfranchise
   black voters in the U.S. from 1890-1965. We conducted a critical
   rhetorical analysis of the documents using McCornack's (1992) deceptive
   messaging criteria.
   Results: We found that even though the rhetorical and technical style
   and tone of the documents appeared to be objective and neutral, the
   literacy tests served as a technology of disenfranchisement, a way to
   oppress and marginalize, black voters.
   Conclusion: We argue that texts and technologies are not always designed
   with goodwill in mind and texts and technologies that are complicit in
   supporting and promoting oppressive practices have social, cultural,
   embodied, and material impacts on communities. We assert that technical
   communicators can look for possibilities and opportunities for resisting
   discrimination through texts.},

Title = {Toward a Critical Alignment with Efficiency Philosophies},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {64},

Pages = {27-37},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Research has indicated technical and professional communicators
   (TPCs) continue to struggle with establishing value in the workplace.
   Studies advocate for more effective communication with management, but
   scholarship has yet to adequately address the relationship between
   establishing and explaining value and management philosophy. This
   article takes up the two issues of workplace value and ``speaking the
   language of business{''} as they relate to management efficiency
   philosophy, specifically Lean and Six Sigma. I argue that management
   philosophy, particularly efficiency philosophies, is an integral, yet
   often overlooked, aspect of organizational context that affects both
   organizational structures and cultures.
   Method: I share the results of an ethnographic study of a series of
   trainings that were part of a Lean initiative. I buttress these
   observations with two documents, one internal and one customer-facing,
   from Lean Six Sigma initiatives.
   Results: The trainings illustrate the work of creating an organizational
   culture and the importance of communication in developing a sustainable
   Lean culture. The two documents are examples of how processes and
   workflow (e.g., organizational structures) are written in efficiency
   environments.
   Conclusion: Practitioners and researchers should see efficiency
   management philosophies as important components of organizational
   contexts not to be glossed over. Communication is acknowledged as
   important to maintaining culture, but TPC knowledge and expertise are
   not necessarily recognized. The two documents show opportunities in
   these kinds of cultures to make work visible and establish value.},

Title = {Is It ``About Us{''}? Self-Representation of Technical Communication
   Consultants, Independent Contractors, and Companies on the Web},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {267-285},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article explores the purposes, character, and efficacy of
   ``about us{''} information that technical communication contractors,
   consultants, and companies post on their business Web sites.
   Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 independent
   technical communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services,
   and interviewed a subset of survey respondents.
   Results: Overall, participants perceived their Web site's information
   about both their business and themselves to be somewhat useful in
   marketing their services, though they were also divided about which of
   these two types was the more useful. Regardless of whether their
   business comprised just themselves or a larger corporation with
   associates, some participants foregrounded their business's identity to
   build credibility whereas others foregrounded their own and their
   associates' personal identities to build rapport.
   Conclusion: ``About us{''} information about a business and about its
   people can be usefully conceived as two distinct types of information,
   each deployed selectively to serve distinct purposes. Among the factors
   that may influence whether and how a technical communication business
   would foreground a corporate face or a personal face are not necessarily
   its corresponding corporate or personal status but instead the
   business's industry, its location internationally, its size, and the
   qualifications and gender of its people.},

Title = {World-Traveling to Redesign a Map for Migrant Women: Humanitarian
   Technical Communication in Praxis},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {56-72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Humanitarian audiences are inaccessible to our traditional
   methods of research. Audiences like migrants often rely on technical
   communication to find humanitarian aid; however, there are few
   methodologies that can help us improve materials for them. This project
   explores world-traveling to demonstrate how the methods of other fields
   can help us take a proactive approach in critiquing and improving the
   technical communication from humanitarian operations.Methods:
   World-traveling is the practice of seeing through another's eyes to
   anticipate what they may need (Lugones, 2003). It calls us to travel
   from our privileged ``worlds,{''} spaces we inhabit as scholars, into
   the worlds of vulnerable populations. The practice helps researchers
   understand the worlds of marginalized populations and help them. I
   world-travel to migrant women in an archive to improve a map that
   migrants use to find water in the Arizona desert.Results:
   World-traveling allowed me to anticipate problems. I found that migrant
   women are at a much higher risk of death by exposure than men and that
   the current maps of water hide this risk. I redesigned the map with the
   intent to lessen the risk of death by exposure for migrant women. The
   redesign made it clear that women are at risk of a certain harm while
   also taking steps to humanize the women displayed on the map.Conclusion:
   World-traveling allowed me to show migrant women the increased risk of
   death by exposure through a redesigned map. The result is more useful
   and humane technical communication.},

Title = {Amplifying Indigenous Voices through a Community of Stories Approach},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {56-73},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Using the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) controversy as a case
   study, I argue that not only do counter narratives need to be told, but
   a reframing of storytelling toward what I call a community of stories
   approach is needed in order to amplify marginalized voices, particularly
   those of Indigenous people.
   Methods: Built on the foundational methodologies of case study and
   Indigenous methodologies, I investigate the documentation surrounding
   the Dakota Access Pipeline case. In an effort to understand how to
   amplify Indigenous voices in counter narratives, I rely on antenarrative
   analysis, storytelling, and listening.
   Results: My findings suggest that conceptualizing stories as
   interrelated communities provides a strategy for amplifying Indigenous
   voices and revising Western approaches to environmental risk. I offer
   three different approaches to understanding the relationships among
   stories. The first is the dominant narrative versus counter narrative,
   the second is the layered narrative, and the third is a community of
   stories. Each of these three approaches offers an increasingly complex
   way of thinking about stories and storytelling, the relationships
   between power, and which stories are amplified and which ones are not.
   Conclusion: Decolonized storytelling methodologies and communities of
   stories can play important roles in helping technical communicators
   understand the diverse narratives of any case. Because there is not a
   case in the world that is not flanked by dominant and counter
   narratives-all cases have a dominant narrative and layers of counter
   narratives-technical communication and rhetoric (TCR) teachers and
   practitioners are presented with an important opportunity to do the
   critical work that communities of stories demand.},

Title = {Flexible Project Management Processes: A Case Study of a Distributed
   Trade Organization},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {136-152},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article examines project management and technical
   communicators at the distributed workplace of a trade association.
   Members work with association writers to actively influence the content
   and products, resulting in a unique rhetorical situation that drives
   iterative and flexible project management processes.
   Method: This case study draws from semi-structured retrospective
   interviews conducted as part of a larger ethnographic study of trade
   organization communicators, their educational products, and their
   interaction with association members.
   Results: The organizational structure of a trade organization results in
   a rhetorical situation in which technical communicators interact
   constantly with association members in both informal and formal
   settings, which leads to invention for informational products. The
   association restructured their communications team twice during this
   study in efforts to get more workers in contact with members and to
   create better content packages where editors, designers, and other
   specialists have input at multiple stages. Restructuring and the
   participation of members meant project management strategies must be
   flexible and arise from the rhetorical situation.
   Conclusion: Though not drawing on specific project management strategies
   like Six Sigma or Agile, this organization creates and adapts flexible
   processes so that technical communicators can best serve their
   organizational mission. In addition, processes respond to the rhetorical
   situation created between members and writers, as well as between
   managers and technical communicators. Managers work to empower these TCs
   who are taking on more project management roles.},

Title = {Cooperation or Compliance: Building Dialogic Codes of Conduct},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-18},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Adapting the ethics of philosopher Henri Bergson, this article
   offers a theory to explain the volatile legal-ethical environment in
   which codes of conduct operate and proposes that technical communicators
   adopt this theory to build dialogic codes of conduct.
   Method: The article explicates and illustrates Bergson's theory of
   social and dynamic moralities (i.e., ethics as regulation of cooperative
   individuals and ethics as inspiration by heroic individuals) and offers
   a critical reading of three corporate codes of conduct from the
   perspective of this theory, emphasizing five factors: language
   emphasizing cooperation versus compliance, identification of authorship,
   clarity of ethical versus legal obligations, inclusion of humanizing
   pictorial images, and coverage of heroic individuals.
   Results: None of the corporate codes of conduct examined truly exploit
   the immense rhetorical power of narrative or illustrations. None
   exclusively emphasize cooperation or entirely specify authorship. None
   are altogether lucid or consistent in separating legal and ethical
   issues. Existing practices yield a missed opportunity to inspire as well
   as stipulate ethical behavior.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators are skilled in rhetoric, studied in
   ethics, and experienced in writing policies and instructions and in
   soliciting information from sources of knowledge and power. Technical
   communicators could thus be uniquely qualified to develop dialogic codes
   of conduct for corporations, industries, and professions.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {121-128},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Linking, when properly executed, enhances the value of content by
   providing a consistent perspective and organizational scheme that
   enriches the user's experience. Link authoring, like content authoring,
   is a creative process of making connections between disparate yet
   related information. Effective link authoring requires intellect,
   creativity, and domain knowledge to define the relationships among
   concepts that can support a particular pedagogical objective. The
   contribution of hypermedia link authoring is often poorly understood and
   unrecognized by traditional academic and publishing communities.
   Publishers of commercial and academic hypermedia typically neither
   formally recognize link authoring as something that should be protected
   by copyright, nor do they extend to those involved in link authoring the
   same degree of credit or remuneration given conventional content authors
   or illustrators. However, with the recent explosive growth in hypermedia
   publishing via the World Wide Web, CD-ROM, and other digital forms, the
   significance of link authoring is becoming more apparent. Clearly, a new
   paradigm is in order, one that recognizes the contribution of link
   authoring in the communication of thoughts, emotions, and information.},

Title = {Incorporating Computer-Mediated Communications in EFL Reading},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {72-85},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: The incorporation of computer-mediated communication (CMC) has
   been widely used in recent English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching
   and learning due to the rapid advancement of technology. Despite the
   prevalence of online CMC communications, previous research has yielded
   mixed results, and empirical evidence on how online communications
   affect student reading comprehension is limited. This study compares the
   effects of online asynchronous and synchronous communications on EFL
   reading comprehension in a Taiwanese collaborative learning context.
   Method: Ten reading comprehension tests and an online questionnaire
   survey were administered to 100 university students enrolled in two
   senior reading classes in Southern Taiwan. Independent-sample t-tests,
   descriptive statistics, and Pearson product-moment correlation analyses
   were computed to investigate the differences and relationships between
   perceived asynchronous and synchronous communication use on EFL reading
   comprehension performance. Results: The findings revealed that
   participants used the synchronous communication mode more frequently
   than the asynchronous mode. The reading score obtained through the
   synchronous group was slightly higher than that obtained through the
   asynchronous group; no statistically significant difference was found.
   As students practiced more in asynchronous and synchronous communication
   modes, their reading comprehension ability improved significantly.
   Conclusion: Although learners generally accept both online communication
   modes, the open-ended question results reveal several disadvantages and
   advantages of online communication environments. The study's
   limitations, as well as the implications for instructional pedagogy and
   future research, are presented and discussed.},

Title = {The Pedagogical Opportunities of Technical Standards: Learning from the
   Electronic Product Code},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {42-53},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: The goal of this article is to make the case that technical
   standards can be valuable educational tools for technical communication
   teachers. The article argues for the pedagogical value of standards
   through an examination of one particular standard: the Tag Data
   Standard, published by GS1. The analysis focuses on areas in which the
   document could be improved by technical communication practitioners and
   students.
   Method: The data for this article come from the 126-page Tag Data
   Standard. The standard was inductively analyzed using grounded theory
   and involved a second coder. The research question that guided this
   analysis was, ``How could this comprehensive standard be improved by
   trained technical communicators?{''} The goal is to show how technical
   standards could be used to provide students with real-world texts to
   analyze and edit.
   Results: The data show the TDS could likely be improved if technical
   communication practitioners were more involved in the writing process to
   focus on issues of consistency, audience, and design. The article uses
   those results to show why standards could be valuable educational tools
   for teachers.
   Conclusion: Standards are a crucial form of technical communication.
   They are an example of how language shapes the material world. The
   analysis in this article shows that these crucial documents can be
   improved by skilled technical communicators and can serve multiple
   pedagogical goals, including showing students how documents shape
   materiality and providing students with comprehensive, real-world texts
   to work with and improve.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper examines the values and expertise associated with a
   kind of technical and professional communication (TPC) that connects an
   organization with individuals in the practice of their everyday lives.
   It is an attempt to engage institutional forms of workplace
   communication embodied in the values of GiveDirectly (GD) and associated
   with an emerging model of humanitarian aid.
   Method: This study analyzed the content of GD's website, specifically,
   its articulated values and how they fit into organizational knowledge
   and workplace writing. This analysis illuminates the type of
   communication and informs the nature of expertise made possible by a
   values approach to technical communication.
   Results: TPC can add value to humanitarian organizations by articulating
   the relationship among technology, the interface, and real (not
   imagined) user needs in their cultural contexts.
   Conclusion: Articulating values can mobilize the technical expertise
   necessary to revitalize humanitarian aid by placing human beings
   directly at the center of giving and receiving, thus demonstrating that
   what people in the Global South, often ranked low on the Human
   Development Index, need is a values-oriented approach to TPC.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents results from a primary study investigating
   the qualities of memorable documents and extrapolates principles for
   making documents more memorable, and thus more effective, for audiences.
   Method: I asked twenty subjects to walk down a high school hallway
   decorated with flyers and posters. I interviewed them immediately
   afterward and one week later to determine which information ``stuck{''}
   over time as well as the subjects' self-reported reasons for recalling
   information. I then analyzed the most-often remembered documents to
   correlate the subjects' responses to the documents' content, design,
   style, etc.
   Results: Contrast, color, and imagery are inherently attention-catching
   and memorable. However, engaging the audience's collective self-schema,
   or identity, impacts memory even more powerfully by prompting readers to
   ascribe relevance to information and thus strive to remember it.
   Accordingly, I propose the following heuristic for creating more
   effective, mnemonic documents: (a) convey practical value; (b) use
   contrast, color, and imagery; (c) tap the familiar; (d) introduce
   unexpected elements; (e) build social currency; and (f) arouse emotion.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators can enhance their documents'
   effectiveness by using the proposed heuristic to make information more
   memorable for their readers.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Is the current style guide helping our business? Does it give
   us an edge over our competitors in reaching out to people? Company
   executives ask these questions before allocating budgets and resources
   for the documentation team. A style guide is a rule-driven document that
   sets the parameters for consistency and acceptability of all written
   materials produced by an organization. But, is that the sole function of
   a style guide? This paper lays out key fundamentals of how to make an
   effective style guide and explores its benefits. The article also
   illustrates the process of developing a style guide in detail while
   satisfying the needs of the organization.
   Method: To understand the best practices in the industry, a comparative
   analysis of five style guides of global software companies was done.
   Further, an online survey was administered to the technical writing
   community to collect more information. To get first-hand feedback from
   professionals, seven technical writers were interviewed and discussions
   in online technical writing forums were facilitated.
   Result: In addition to generating document consistency, 82\% of the
   survey participants concurred that an effective style guide helps in
   creating a distinct brand image. Word usage, new terminology, document
   formatting and meeting needs of global audience are important topics
   that need constant attention during designing a style guide.
   Conclusion: A style guide will have a successful impact when it is
   supported by management, incorporates broader inputs from all its
   beneficiaries, is integrated into the day-to-day operations, and is
   updated periodically.},

   interaction. Specifically, this study explores how Web design rules have
   evolved since the mid-1990s and the influencing factors, if Web design
   instruction has dictated rules or encouraged designers to think
   critically about the design decisions being made, and, finally, if Web
   design principles are based on cognitive learning or visual
   communication theories, situated in best practices, or simply
   replicated.
   Method: Content analysis of a sampling of 40 textbooks and
   general-interest publications on Web design from 1995 to 2014.
   Results: Overall, Web design texts encourage designers to think
   critically about audiences. Changing technology clearly played a key
   role in the evolution of instruction. Finally, Web design instruction
   included some level of reference to cognitive learning theory or visual
   communication theory. While the appearance of theory-based word units in
   Web design texts coupled with discussion about technological
   capabilities and audience suggests Web design instruction does a solid
   job of situating design practices in theory, technology, and the complex
   situations in which the Web user operates, the depth of discussion
   varies greatly from text to text.
   Conclusion: The various treatments of theory in texts calls for further
   study to better understand which approach is more effective in
   communicating the theories as a whole as well as their application in
   Web design.},

Title = {Eight Guidelines for the Design of Instructional Videos for Software

Abstract = {Purpose: Video has become a popular means for delivering ``how to{''}
   information about a wide variety of software tasks. With video rapidly
   becoming a major instructional method, the question arises of their
   effectiveness for software training. This paper provides a set of eight
   guidelines for the construction of instructional videos for software
   training.
   Method: The guidelines present a concise view on how to design an
   instructional video for software training. They are based on a
   considerable body of research on how people process visual and verbal
   information and how to support these processes. Each guideline is
   described, illustrated, and supported with research findings from
   various disciplines.
   Results: The guidelines were tested in three consecutive empirical
   studies. In these studies a set of instructional videos for Word's
   formatting options were designed. The effects of the video instructions
   were compared with a paper tutorial (Van der Meij \& Van der Meij, in
   preparation). We found that the video instructions yielded more
   favorable appraisals for motivation, higher skills proficiency
   immediately after training, and better skills retention after a one-week
   delay.
   Conclusions: The guidelines offer patterns that could further advance
   the theory and practice of the design of instructional videos for
   software training. A limitation of the study is that we concentrated on
   instructional video that serve a tutorial function. For video that
   function as a reference guide not all the guidelines are equally
   important, and also some new guidelines may be called for.},

Volume = {58},

Pages = {19-33},

Abstract = {Purpose: The case study described in this article explores a U. S.
   team's adaptation of organizational training for Japanese audiences,
   with a particular focus on the team's management of social and physical
   spaces in which the training took place.
   Method: Qualitative research was used in this study, specifically a case
   study based on ethnological methods including interviews, observations,
   and collection of relevant documents.
   Results: Localization of the social and physical spaces that surround
   organizational training spaces includes recognizing their potential
   function as an important site for professional communication, especially
   in relationship-oriented cultures such as Japan. Beyond the need for
   this conceptual understanding, localization of organizational training
   also requires the practical navigation of these spaces. Such facility
   depends on professional communicators' understanding of proxemics, or
   the human use of space in cultural contexts, as well as wise reliance on
   the guidance of cultural insiders.
   Conclusions: When professional communicators work to localize
   organizational training, they must include all relevant communication
   channels and work to actively manage the physical and social spaces
   through which relationships are built and information is passed. An
   awareness of how space is used as a means of communication across
   cultures is essential.},

Title = {Helping Content Strategy: What Technical Communicators Can Do for
   Non-Profits},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Contemporary non-profit organizations must reach a variety of
   audiences in order to sustain themselves and must compel these audiences
   to take action on behalf of a specific cause. At the same time, past
   research has indicated that non-profit professionals often lack the
   necessary training and expertise to leverage digital technologies for
   effective communication. This research study explores how technical
   communicators can assist non-profits by helping them develop effective
   content strategies.
   Method: This report of research findings is based on an ongoing
   Participatory Action Research (PAR) project, which included a series of
   focus groups with representatives of thirteen different organizations as
   well as interventions with several other organizations. The goal has
   been to learn about and help improve non-profit content strategy in the
   community of Greenville, North Carolina.
   Results: We found that while non-profits do rely on a variety of media
   to fulfill their goals, they prefer pre-digital media. Our participants
   also defined audiences in a very loose manner, used content in a
   non-targeted way, and favored existing organizational processes over
   content strategy best practices.
   Conclusions: Ultimately, we provide several ways technical communicators
   can assist non-profits through low-cost or free consulting and the
   development of educational materials. We hope that fellow professionals
   will engage in this necessary work because non-profits in the United
   States form an important ``third sector{''} of the economy that provides
   essential services to countless individuals.},

   Textbooks},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},

Pages = {87-102},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Students enroll in college to gain expertise for the workplace.
   Students are trained in academia to avoid plagiarism by citing sources
   and refraining from copying others' written works. However, in workplace
   writing and technical communication, common workplace practices reuse,
   repurpose, and remix content of works authored by others. Unfortunately,
   this causes a significant disconnect between what students learn and how
   this learning applies in the workplace. The following questions guided
   the study:
   1. How do the latest editions of widely used technical communication
   textbooks in the United States teach students about plagiarism,
   collaboration/authorship, copyright, and ethics?
   2. How do the approaches used in textbooks align with workplace
   practices?
   Method: In the first phase of the analysis, each textbook was searched
   to locate any depictions of plagiarism, collaboration/authorship,
   copyright, and ethics as they relate to the workplace. Then a
   qualitative content analysis was conducted using a rating scale
   developed incorporating suggestions researchers made on how to best
   teach plagiarism and copyright infringement avoidance.
   Results: Each of the eight texts was rated on each criterion with a
   possible total of 30 points. Most texts scored 10 or less, one scored
   12, and two of the texts scored 15 or above. The extent to which
   introductory textbooks address each of the criteria was generally
   abysmal. The texts largely did not address common types of workplace
   writing and how copyright and plagiarism apply in those situations.
   Conclusion: The majority of widely used introductory technical
   communication textbooks do not thoroughly and clearly explain
   plagiarism, collaboration/authorship, copyright, and ethics in workplace
   writing. Additionally, these textbooks do not present context-specific
   scenarios to which students can apply this information. However, several
   of the texts do provide examples of workplace activities that contradict
   academic views of authorship.},

Title = {What is on the Traditional Herbal Medicine Label? Technical
   Communication and Patient Safety in Ghana},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-19},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: With a focus on patient safety in the marketing and use of
   non-prescription traditional herbal medicines (THMs), this article
   reports the findings of an analysis of documentation practices
   associated with 15 sampled THMs (nine labeled and six unlabeled)
   selected from stores, pharmaceutical shops, buses, traditional clinics,
   and streets of Ghana. The article is based on the fundamental assumption
   that THMs, much like conventional drugs, have side effects or toxic
   components, and therefore require effective documentation to alert
   users.
   Method: The article employs the purposive sampling strategy of critical
   case sampling to analyze the 15 THM samples. This approach allowed me to
   select information-rich cases. These cases shed light on the challenges
   of labeling THMs and how those challenges impact patient safety. Using
   these cases, I made logical generalizations based on the outcomes of the
   analysis of the data.
   Results: My observations revealed that some manufacturers made few
   attempts to provide information about the importance of pre-existing
   medical conditions, contraindications, period of use, who to contact or
   how to respond in case of overdose or adverse reactions, detailed dosage
   instructions, side effects, and potential drug interactions.
   Conclusion: Although medical and health communication is a growing area
   in the field of technical communication, the specific topic of patient
   safety as it relates to THM documentation remains underexplored.
   Moreover, the relationship between patient safety and THMs is an
   important aspect of the healthcare needs for many people, and therefore
   deserves more attention.},

Title = {A Study of the Websites of the 42 Double First-class Chinese
   Universities: How Does Confucianism Influence the Content on Chinese
   University Websites?},

Abstract = {Purpose: Based on my examination of the websites of 42 elite Chinese
   universities, this article reveals relationships between Confucian
   notions of collectivism and deference to superiors and content features
   on the university websites.
   Method: Using content analysis, I examined the following features on the
   homepages of the Chinese university websites three times in three
   consecutive months:
   1. political/national agendas,
   2. history and tradition,
   3. important people,
   4. groups of people; and
   5. campus views.
   Results: My three examinations indicate that the Chinese university
   websites consistently show certain aspects of the above five features,
   which serve rhetorical and social purposes: political and national
   agenda claiming authorship of website content, history/tradition
   justifying current status, important people guiding university work,
   large groups of people showcasing the CPC ideologies, and campus
   buildings and structures symbolizing social elites.
   Conclusion: Confucianism helps us discern patterns in the design of
   Chinese university websites. Despite its limitations, this study serves
   as a small window into the many relationships between Confucianism and
   Chinese university websites.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Facebook is a place where political candidates actively
   advertise and campaign, and where a large population of citizens share
   and interact with information about political issues and with one
   another. I explore how Facebook's UX/interface design has contributed to
   user engagements that have implications for the current political
   context within which we live and work.
   Method: I engage in a critical user interface analysis focusing on four
   key microinteractions on the site: browsing, reacting, commenting, and
   posting.
   Results: My analysis shows that Facebook's user interface is structured
   around several design choices that create an ethic that prioritizes
   concision, speed, curation practices that limit divergent perspectives,
   and the flattening of complex identities and political commitments such
   that they are indexable, processable, and thus, monetizable.
   Conclusion: The analysis presented here considers the relationship
   between user experience design and political engagement. As such, this
   paper helps industry practitioners to see 1) how technology designs
   create new, mediated intimacies over time and 2) how those relationships
   have implications for user engagement with politicized content.},

Title = {Toward Multidirectional Knowledge Flows: Lessons from Research and
   Publication Practices of Technical Communication Entrepreneurs},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {299-313},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article asks what can be learned about knowledge flows in
   the field of technical communication from the networking activities that
   independent entrepreneurs use to learn relevant information, influence
   practice, and build professional conversations.
   Method: The article uses qualitative methods informed by theories of
   social network analysis to examine interview data collected from eight
   successful technical communication entrepreneurs.
   Results: Technical communication entrepreneurs actively publish and read
   publications to learn relevant information about the field, influence
   practice, and build professional conversations. Academic publications
   are often outside these entrepreneurs' scope of interest because of
   differing timescales, venues, and key terms; however, they often read
   publications of and publish toward the professional networks generated
   as they connect with others for business interests.
   Conclusion: The field must continue to find ways to bridge academic and
   practitioner divides by seeking common venues, shared timelines, and
   collaborating on emerging topics of interest. However, these divides are
   more complex than simply among academics and practitioners, as knowledge
   flows in the field have become multidirectional rather than two-sided.},

Title = {Converging Fields, Expanding Outcomes: Technical Communication,
   Translation, and Design at a Non-profit Organization},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {126-140},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this article is to illustrate how processes of
   translation, technical communication, and design converge in the
   development and dissemination of multilingual content at a non-profit
   organization in the US.
   Method: As part of a larger project, the researchers observed and
   recorded (through video footage and field notes) translation activities
   taking place in a Language Services office during the course of two
   years. To visualize translation activities, the researchers used
   screencast recordings that captured how translators coordinated digital
   resources (e.g., digital translation tools, online dictionaries) to
   successfully translate information. Finally, the researchers conducted
   12 artifact-based interviews with translators at the research site.
   Results: Results show that translation, technical communication, and
   design activities are enacted iteratively and recursively by
   participants at this research site. Translators at this site must work
   across diverse design processes (UX design, information design, visual
   and document design) that often get subsumed into the translation
   process. Although employees within this organization do not consider
   themselves designers or technical communicators, the work that takes
   place within this office requires expertise across these areas of study
   and practice.
   Conclusion: Designing and creating multilingual content often requires
   the intellectual contributions of individuals who can move across
   translation, technical communication, and design activities
   simultaneously. As the field of technical communication (particularly in
   the US) continues to acknowledge the value of global, multilingual
   content, it's important that we highlight the expertise and added value
   of the multilingual communicators who make this work possible and
   accessible to users across cultures and languages.},

Title = {Designing for a Culturally Inclusive Democracy: A Case Study of Voter
   Registration Outreach Postcards in Latino Communities},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {154-165},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article examines a field study I co-authored urging
   Washington State residents to register online as voters (Mann \& Pryor,
   2014).
   Method: Using leading design principles, I created postcards for the
   Office of the Washington Secretary of State that were mailed to
   unregistered residents. In addition to measuring the overall
   effectiveness of the postcards, the study evaluated the differences
   between two rhetorical messages. Both postcards described the same
   registration process, but one focused on the user-friendly aspects of
   the online application while the other emphasized that registering to
   vote is a social norm.
   Results: Residents in three counties with large Latino populations were
   mailed bilingual English-Spanish postcards. The total treatment effect
   was significantly higher among recipients in these counties than the
   rest of the state but with no noticeable difference between two
   rhetorical messages. Statewide, the overall results show that the
   postcard describing the voter registration experience as ``fast and
   easy{''} was significantly more effective than persuading recipients to
   register using social pressure. Emphasizing convenience was especially
   effective among 18-year-olds.
   Conclusion: The study suggests that election administrators can create a
   more culturally inclusive voter registration process by designing
   bilingual outreach materials. This article offers several lessons
   learned for voter outreach design and discusses potential avenues for
   the continued study of culturally inclusive UX practices as applied to
   voter registration outreach.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-153},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical communication practitioners and scholars need to push
   the boundaries of user experience scholarship to develop more culturally
   sensitive design and research methods that address global digital
   divides. In this spirit, I examined the local ways in which community
   technology center (CTC) tutors helped teach inexperienced users how to
   use information and communication technologies (ICTs) during basic
   computer courses.
   Method: I collected data through ethnographic methods including
   participant-observation, qualitative interviews, and extant documents.
   Using grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser \& Strauss, 1967; Strauss
   \& Corbin, 1990), I developed open codes and constantly compared codes
   to develop categories and properties.
   Results: Inexperienced ICT users are unable to utilize online and other
   resources because they often lack the necessary physical experience
   working with ICTs and the cultural knowledge to operate them. CTC tutors
   serve as local technical communication experts who construct effective
   methods for helping learners by: 1) utilizing visual representations, 2)
   utilizing audible representations, and 3) heightening learner awareness
   for visual cues.
   Conclusion: Inexperienced users struggle with using ICT hardware and
   software. An on-the-ground approach to studying usability in the field
   makes user experience research both more inclusive and comprehensive.
   Such insight from inexperienced users sheds light on how digital
   inequalities persist and how practitioners and scholars can work to
   ensure inexperienced users are not forgotten in UX research.},

Title = {What User Forums Teach Us about Documentation and the Value Added by
   Technical Communicators},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-28},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: To describe the practice of technical documentation on software
   user forums and consider what value technical communicators add when
   they are no longer solely responsible for generating help content. Argue
   that documentation needs undergo a shift as users' tasks expand beyond
   what is directly accommodated in the software's design. Users no longer
   need stabilization knowledge (knowledge of what software is designed to
   do) but possibility knowledge (knowledge of what the software is capable
   of doing).
   Method: Interviews with moderators and frequent posters on four software
   user communities for Microsoft Excel, Adobe InDesign, Mozilla
   Thunderbird, and GIMP. Questions probe the participants' sense of what
   makes helpful contributions on software user forums. Answers are coded
   thematically.
   Results: Moderators and frequent posters stress the importance of
   maintaining high quality content and high quality social interactions.
   High quality content is that which is credible and situationally
   authentic, expansive, and targeted. High quality interactions are those
   that effectively involve multiple members of a community and distribute
   responsibility for addressing user problems to those community members
   with the most suitable experience/expertise.
   Conclusions: While community members may adequately generate the
   necessary help content, technical communicators are needed for abilities
   that are also strongly associated with the profession but that often
   seem of secondary importance. Technical communicators may be skilled
   moderators who can use their genre knowledge to correct, clarify, and
   contextualize software problems; use their interpersonal skills to help
   maintain ties among members of the community; and use their knowledge of
   text usability and organizational communication to create infrastructure
   for storing and retrieving help content that is performed in the user
   community.},

Title = {Remote Technical Communicators: Accessing Audiences and Working on

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This pilot study investigates challenges experienced by
   technical communicators who work remotely from their audiences and
   project teams and identifies factors that contribute to success in these
   work arrangements.
   Method: I surveyed and interviewed seven technical communicators who
   worked remotely as consultants for large U.S. corporate organizations,
   including two Fortune 500 financial services companies, a professional
   services firm, and a safety certification organization. No participant
   performed more than 15\% of her work on-site. Each participant had a
   minimum of three years' experience working remotely and had previous
   experience working as an on-site technical communicator for other
   organizations. The surveys and follow-up interviews provided qualitative
   data, which I then coded and analyzed.
   Results: Unlike local technical communicators, who may have limited
   contact with their end-user audience, these remote technical
   communicators had no direct contact with their end-user audience and
   instead relied on other in-house and remote team members (such as
   project managers) to provide audience information. The remote technical
   communicators reported facing challenges such as lack of social
   interaction; inability to stop working; and a lack of information and
   resources. They reported using various skills and strategies to cope
   with challenges, citing communication, self-discipline/motivation, and
   organization/structure the most frequently.
   Conclusion: Given the trend of organizations choosing to outsource
   writing and training jobs and hire consultants to take on these roles,
   technical communicators should acquaint themselves with the potential
   challenges of working on a remote team. Study participants reported such
   challenges as difficulty building trusting, new relationships; missing
   out on small talk and sometimes even critical conversations; and feeling
   isolated.},

Title = {Deep Audience Analysis: A Proposed Method for Analyzing Audiences for
   Environment-Related Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {94-117},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this article I propose an audience analysis instrument
   designed to assess representative members of a desired target
   population's underlying predispositions in terms of the sources of
   information they privilege, their motivations toward environment-related
   action, and the commonplaces that impact their perceptions of
   environment-related communication. The goal of this method is to offer a
   time- and cost-effective instrument that enables organizations to easily
   classify an audience's interest in environmentalism, assess their
   willingness to listen to and accept environment-related messaging, and
   pinpoint the commonplace elements likely to be most useful in
   constructing environment-related communication.
   Method: I developed the interview, coding sheet, instructions for
   completing the process, and glossary that make up the Deep Audience
   Analysis instrument from existing data presented elsewhere (Ross 2013,
   2012, 2008), and refined the instrument through both participatory
   design and usability testing.
   Results: The results of my testing suggest that the Deep Audience
   Analysis tool I propose is both valid and reliable, but training with
   the instrument would prove beneficial, and triangulation with multiple
   coders is optimal. Organizations adopting this method of audience
   analysis would do well to practice with the instrument and have norming
   sessions before putting the instrument to use in the field.
   Conclusion: The audience analysis instrument I propose here includes an
   interview script, code sheet, instructions for completing the process,
   and glossary. The method proposed here should serve as a time- and
   cost-effective paper-based strategy for organizations wishing a deeper
   understanding of their audience(s).},

Title = {Techniques for Introducing Unfamiliar Terms},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-108},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This investigation identifies, classifies, and explains a wide
   range of techniques for introducing unfamiliar terms into a document. It
   enables professional writers to improve their writing. These techniques
   are also applicable to spoken discourse, including multimedia and
   interactive dialogues.
   Method: The investigation employs a linguistic framework derived from
   applied linguistics, psycholinguistics, and eye-movement research. The
   framework consists of (1) the triad of term, class, and characteristic,
   most familiar in the context of formal definition; (2) the location of
   the unfamiliar term in relation to the other parts of the explanation;
   (3) the distinctive marking of the term, usually with quotation marks or
   italics; and (4) the effect of explanatory context.
   Results: Certain syntactic constructions and distinctive marking assure
   readers that either the unfamiliar term will be explained or that an
   explanation of the term is not necessary for a productive reading of the
   text. Class-first constructions are especially versatile in introducing
   unfamiliar terms. Ongoing changes in reading and writing may lead to
   changes in the techniques used to introduce unfamiliar terms. Special
   cases are examined: parenthetical constructions, ``so-called{''} as a
   means to introduce unfamiliar terms, the uses of extra-linear display
   (above-the-line and pop-up definitions), the problem of multiple
   instances of unfamiliar terms in lengthy documents, and the distinctive
   practices we find in online help systems.
   Conclusion: The linguistic framework developed here contributes to our
   understanding of how to introduce technical terminology and can improve
   the work of writers.},

Title = {The Participatory Culture of Technical Communication in Online Gaming
   Communities},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {284-295},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Games-based technical communication is created both by and for
   gamers within the virtual space(s) in which most of these games (and
   players) exist. The lines between the real and virtual blur as gamers
   create documents across various modes and genres. This study looks not
   just at what gamers within these participatory cultures create but also
   how and why they create it.
   Method: I used a multi-dimensional case study approach to analyze
   content from 10 game-related websites. I then applied content analysis
   and rhetorical analysis to explore what types of technical communication
   artifacts are created on gaming websites, how such artifacts are
   created, and how gamers use technical communication to rhetorically
   represent themselves both socially and professionally within their
   gaming communities.
   Results: I present three major findings: (1) a list of genres of
   games-based technical communication; (2) an analysis of why gamers
   create such materials, including motivations linked to personal
   connections, professional connections, reputation, and rhetorical
   exigence; and (3) a discussion of how gamers write technical
   communication in the context of their affinity spaces and participatory
   cultures, as well as the modes and media they use.
   Conclusion: Players in participatory cultures consistently create
   game-based materials as part of their social identities, stretching
   across modes and media to suit their rhetorical goals. To that end, we
   have much to learn by studying not just online gaming communities but,
   specifically, the technical communication artifacts these groups
   individually and collectively create.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article surveyed technical communication professionals to
   find out what issues they believed were the most important of the past
   five years in order to better understand the technical communication
   workplace and its demands.
   Method: The article used an online survey to elicit responses from a
   specific pool of practitioners. The professionals surveyed were members
   of the Society for Technical Communication.
   Results: The survey received 203 responses that were coded and
   categorized, resulting in 677 individual subcategory entries.
   Conclusion: The survey comments were sorted into four broad categories:
   technology, information design, the technical communication field, and
   approaches to writing and designing information. Relationships and
   connections within and across these categories are further explored.},

   Value},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {328-344},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study highlights key behaviors three professional
   technical communicators (TCs) used to enhance their professional
   identities and value in unique organizational contexts. It suggests that
   when TCs explicitly promote user advocacy to explain their work
   practices, it more positively represents the work that TCs do to other
   stakeholders.
   Method: Using an ethnographic perspective, we reflect on how grounding
   our thinking, decisions, and actions in user advocacy during
   interactions with non-TCs resulted in successful outcomes.
   Results: Promoting user advocacy while conducting user-centered design
   and user experience (UCD/UX) activities resulted in positive perceptions
   about our technical communication work; it broadened how non-TCs viewed
   our work beyond predetermined technical communication contexts.
   Conclusion: Promoting user advocacy in tandem with UCD/UX methods may
   provide a productive avenue for TCs to connect their value to broader
   organizational goals and promote and preserve positive workplace
   identities.},

Title = {Cultural Differences and User Instructions: Effects of a Culturally
   Adapted Manual Structure on Western and Chinese Users},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {163-182},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Research shows that Western and Chinese technical communicators
   structure their documents in different ways. The research reported in
   this article is a first attempt to systematically explore the effects
   cultural adaptations of user instructions have on users. Specifically,
   we investigate whether Western (from Europe and North America) and
   Chinese (from the People's Republic of China) users would benefit from a
   document structure that is theoretically assumed to reflect their
   cultural preferences.
   Method: Using the SDL Trados Studio 2014 translation software package, a
   2x2 experiment (N=80) was conducted with manual structure (Western
   versus Chinese) and cultural background (Western versus Chinese) as
   independent variables. The Chinese and Western manual structures were
   based on the literature on cultural differences between Western and
   Chinese technical communication. Dependent variables were task
   performance, knowledge, and appreciation of the software and the user
   instructions.
   Results: Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were
   found between the conditions. Both Western and Chinese participants
   performed equally well and were equally appreciative when using the
   Western and Chinese manual structure.
   Conclusion: The results of our study raise questions about the validity
   and/or the relevance of the current insights regarding cultural
   differences in the structures of user instructions. Cultural differences
   found in content analytic research may reflect the habits of technical
   communicators rather than the preferences of users. However, caution is
   needed in interpreting our findings, as our research experiences also
   raised a number of methodological issues that must be addressed in
   future research.},

Title = {Forum Moderation as Technical Communication: The Social Web and
   Employment Opportunities for Technical Communicators},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article examines online help forums as a form of technical
   communication. The purpose of the article is to explore the similarities
   between moderators of help forums and technical communicators. The
   article argues that technical communicators are uniquely suited to step
   in as ``community managers{''} of companies' official online help
   forums.
   Method: This study reports on qualitative research done with 23 help
   forum moderators. The researcher used an iterative grounded theory
   approach to seek out research participants and code the interview data
   to examine emergent data categories. The research was also supplemented
   by six months of observation and an extensive memoing process.
   Results: The interviews with forum moderators show that help forum
   moderation requires many of the skills technical communicators already
   possess. Moderators play an important role in the health of online help
   forums, and they must be able to work with subject-matter experts, edit
   content, organize material, create content, and shape the overall tone
   of the forum.
   Conclusion: Many companies now sponsor official help forums, and these
   companies need community managers to run these sites. The data reported
   in this study show that technical communicators possess the skills to
   succeed in these positions and help develop professional online help
   forums. In conclusion, technical communicators have a strong case to
   make that they are well positioned to step in as community managers,
   especially of professionally sponsored online help forums.},

Abstract = {Surveys and focus groups show that most software buyers use ReadMe
   files. Users primarily look to ReadMe files for information on software
   bugs. They identify the following ways that software manufacturers can
   improve their ReadMe files: 1) keep them short, 2) include a table of
   contents, 3) use hypertext, and 4) eliminate the need for ReadMe files.
   Along with these four improvements, this article discusses other ways to
   create quality ReadMe files that meet concrete user needs.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {69},

Pages = {40-55},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: State historical commissions tend to avoid erecting historical
   marker texts (HMTs), memorials, or monuments that document violence
   towards Black and brown individuals. The Equal Justice Initiative (EJI)
   uses a series of tactics to circumvent local historical commissions to
   memorialize victims of lynching.Methods: In this study, we use the EJI's
   Community Remembrance Project (CRP), an informational handbook for
   community activists, as our data set. We apply the 4Rs (Walton, Moore,
   \& Jones, 2019) and tactical technical communication in our analysis of
   the Community Remembrance Project and argue that the document functions
   as a coalitional, truth-telling tactic to redress inequalities in public
   memory.<br />Results: We found that the EJI's CRP efforts with the
   Historical Marker Project clearly demonstrate how coalitions can
   tactically intervene in racist systems-like historical commissions that
   reject truth-telling efforts-by creating a different path for historical
   markers to be erected in communities.Conclusion: We argue that public
   memory texts often reinforce racism by avoiding topics like racial
   terror lynching and that these omissions have cultural and material
   consequences on communities. We contend that technical communicators can
   intervene in public memory systems and promote truth-telling through
   coalitional approaches to community activism.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article explores the role of storytelling in public spaces
   during the global pandemic. We explore how storytelling can be used as a
   powerful medium of communicating crisis and addressing injustices during
   the pandemic.
   Method: We conducted a rhetorical analysis of the digital stories,
   images, and podcasts from UnCoVer Initiative in China and Nepal
   PhotoProject in Nepal focusing on how these stories act as an
   antenarrative to the dominant pandemic narrative during a crisis.
   Results: We found that both platforms acted as transnational and
   transcultural coalitional spaces, revealing and rejecting injustices
   through critical and reflexive storytelling, building collective
   knowledge on navigating the crisis, and developing solidarity through
   identification.
   Conclusion: Storytelling can be used not only to communicate technical
   information about pandemics but also as a form of resistance to reveal,
   reject, and replace injustices that happen during a crisis.},

Title = {The Mandative Subjunctive in Technical Writing, or the Gap Between
   Subconscious and Conscious Grammatical Knowledge},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {61-86},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: In technical writing, the consistent use of the present
   subjunctive in mandative that-clauses can promote stylistic clarity by
   distinguishing the not-yet actualized from the already actualized. A
   grammar rule requires the use of the present subjunctive in such
   contexts. We tested a group of STEM majors at our university to see
   whether they were predisposed to use the present subjunctive in
   mandative that-clauses when they were composing new content or editing
   existing content.
   Methods: We administered two versions of a performance-based elicitation
   test in eight writing classes: (1) a complete-the-sentence version, in
   which the mandative that-clause lacked a complete predicate, and (2) a
   fill-in-the-blank version, in which the mandative that-clause lacked
   only a verb phrase (i.e., simple predicate). The former required
   composing new content, while the latter required editing existing
   content.
   Results: In the mandative that-clauses across both versions of the test,
   the present indicative was used in 51 percent of the responses, while
   the present subjunctive was used in 28 percent. The present subjunctive
   was used in 249 out of 720 responses (35 percent) on the
   complete-the-sentence version of the test, while it was used in 191 out
   of 828 responses (23 percent) on the fill-in-the-blank version.
   Conclusions: The students used the mandative subjunctive frequently, but
   they used the mandative indicative more frequently. They were more
   likely to use the mandative subjunctive when they were generating
   complete predicates (applying the grammar rule subconsciously in
   composing/drafting) than when they were supplying only simple predicates
   (applying the grammar rule consciously in editing/revising).},

Title = {Audio Description: Making Useful Maps for Blind and Visually Impaired
   People},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {68-85},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical communicators concerned with such issues as media
   accessibility, disability rights, and universal design could explore
   fertile scholarly ground by investigating Audio Description more through
   applied research methods. This article illustrates such potential
   through the explication of a transmodal-translation process conducted on
   National Park Service brochures, including interpretation and
   transformation of their maps into acoustic forms.
   Method: Our mixed-methods approach included feedback from diverse blind,
   visually impaired, and sighted stakeholders, including administrators,
   media designers, and representative park-site users. These insights were
   then tested through field work and complemented by multiple interviews
   and focus groups. During this process, we developed digital
   tools-including open-source software and free mobile apps-for iterative
   testing and sharing of ideas.
   Results: Besides generating thematic and diverse insights about this
   topic, our study also established, developed, and refined a set of
   best-practices guidelines based on research in the field, informed by
   gathered empirical evidence. These guidelines are intended to support
   subject-matter experts at public attractions, regardless of discipline,
   in the creation of better, more accessible maps through Audio
   Description.
   Conclusion: How could a person possibly transform a complex, fully
   visual, and printed-on-paper map into useful acoustic media for blind
   and visually impaired visitors? After consulting the scattered, related
   literature, we oriented our efforts toward the multi-faceted technical
   communication practice of localization. We then dedicated our project
   resources to real-world interventions through both the application and
   the development of audio-description strategies and
   digital-media-delivery systems as a practical and universal approach to
   these related translation and localization problems.},

Title = {Cognitive and Motivational Effects of Practice with Videos for Software
   Training},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},
Pages = {265-279},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Software makers nowadays regularly post videos on their
   websites to satisfy their clients' need for instructional support. Some
   of these designs include an opportunity for practice. This study
   investigated whether the presence and timing of practice affected
   motivation and learning in video-based software training.
   Method: An experiment is reported with four conditions: video-practice
   (VP), practice-video (PV), practice-video-practice (PVP), and video only
   (V). For motivation, the study assessed mood states and flow experience
   during training. In addition, task relevance and self-efficacy were
   measured before and after training. Learning was assessed with several
   performance tests for trained tasks. In addition, a transfer test was
   administered.
   Results: The findings for presence of practice were mixed. Practice
   increased training time and led to more negative mood states during
   training. A clear advantage of practice was found only on the transfer
   test. The findings for timing of practice favored a sequence in which
   instruction preceded practice. Perplexing results were found for the PVP
   condition. The highest learning gains were expected for this condition,
   but, instead, this condition had the lowest performance scores on a
   practice test and immediate post-test.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that the design issue of whether or not
   to complement video-based software training with practice is more
   complex than it seems.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Interactivity in virtual environments has been a key area of
   investigation in fields ranging from technical to creative sectors.
   Scholars find a cross-disciplinary disparity on what interactivity
   embodies and accomplishes. This article traces the definitions of
   interactivity in existing research, devises seven dimensions of
   interactivity for wearables and IoT products, and identifies key roles
   for technical communicators in immersive media design.
   Method: A research review of key literature on interactivity in general
   and technical communication and mobile technologies in particular.
   Results: Current literature shows that concepts of interactivity in
   communication design and technology are multifaceted. Seven dimensions
   of interactivity can be derived for immersive media design: 1)
   reciprocity/ease of response, 2) synchronicity/context awareness, 3)
   connectedness/ubiquity/pervasiveness, 4) navigability/accessibility, 5)
   user control/personalization, 6) entertainment/sensibility, and 7)
   sensory stimulation/multimodality. These dimensions can be mapped onto
   the interactive design of wearables and IoT products. They also inform
   the roles of technical communicators in producing immersive technical
   communication.
   Conclusion: Further investigation of the constructs in interactivity can
   help uncover a more accurate relationship between interactivity and its
   dependent variables. The new dimensions of interactivity in immersive
   media environments suggest that technical communicators and designers
   must pay attention to 1) the seamless connection between the user and
   the systems, data, and actions; 2) user control and customization; 3)
   proactive contextual assistance from smart technologies; and 4) device
   sensibility and sensory stimulations.},

Title = {Enacting Humanitarian Culture: How Technical Communication Facilitates
   Successful Humanitarian Work},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {85-100},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical communicators should look beyond for-profit industry
   to develop a fuller understanding of how technical communication can
   support, enable, and constitute successful work practices. To
   illustrate, we report a subset of findings regarding how technical and
   professional communication supports successful humanitarian work.
   Method: We conducted a three-phase longitudinal study of an
   international humanitarian organization. In Phases 1 and 2, we conducted
   phone/Skype interviews with 25 practitioners, a group including
   international, regional, national, and local levels of the organization.
   In Phase 3, we engaged in ethnographic observation of work practices in
   six countries and conducted a total of 95 additional interviews (in
   person) with humanitarian practitioners.
   Results: Communication plays an important role in the success of
   practitioners' day-to-day work when that communication pursues goals
   relevant to humanitarian culture, such as showing respect for local ways
   of operating. Specifically, our findings show that enacting humanitarian
   culture led practitioners to (a) localize how they speak, (b)
   collaboratively produce written documents, and (c) encourage bottom-up
   organizational communication.
   Conclusion: We found that while many of our field's skills and areas of
   expertise carried over to humanitarian environments, the values and
   motivations associated with humanitarian culture are what influenced the
   effective application of these skills and are, therefore, key to the
   effectiveness of communication. In particular, fine-grained localization
   and empowerment at the lowest level are central to professional
   communication that supports successful humanitarian work.},

   critical multi-site system where a high level of availability is
   necessary.
   Conclusion: Organizational stakeholders were identified as critical for
   success; new authors' previous experiences lacked predictive value;
   existing documentation cultures at one specific site were not studied
   closely enough; and a deeper analysis of risk management with regard to
   the choice of DTD should have been made.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {60},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: The Technical Communication Body of Knowledge (TCBOK) is a
   landmark effort in our profession. To support next-generation
   development efforts, a framework is proposed that will benefit the
   profession: integration with national efforts to develop knowledge
   taxonomies; conceptualization through metaphor; and application through
   imagined user groups (personas) and the communication tasks (genres)
   they commonly perform.
   Method: As an instrumental case study, the TCBOK can be understood and
   expanded through the complementary metaphors of relation and trading
   zones. Both metaphors are examined through a scenario of use for two
   personas.
   Results: While presently designed as taxonomy of knowledge, the TCBOK
   might be expanded through an ecological framework that embraces
   complexity of design and use.
   Conclusions: Three recommendations are provided that may help provide
   direction for TCBOK development: (1) Continue the use of persona as a
   key strategy for information development, but add high-quality genre
   models of best practice; (2) Expand attention from focus on cognitive
   competency domains to include intrapersonal and interpersonal domains;
   (3) Consider the knowledge portal as an opportunity to expand on other
   current efforts to articulate knowledge taxonomies.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article informs practitioners of the types of interactions
   that their peers prefer to have with technical communication students
   and of ways that those interactions can be arranged to the benefit of
   all parties.
   Method: I conducted a survey of STC members regarding interactions
   between practitioners and students. A total of 480 practitioners
   responded. I analyzed and presented the responses.
   Results: Practitioners are interested in and experienced at interacting
   with students in both company-sponsored activities, such as internships,
   and personally initiated activities, such as mentoring and part-time
   teaching. Practitioners acknowledge that students and employers benefit
   from these and other kinds of activities.
   Conclusion: Practitioners can interact with students in ways that help
   the students and that honor the interests and time constraints of the
   practitioners. Practitioners and academics can initiate activities that
   bring practitioners and technical communication students together.},

Title = {An Analysis of Student Comments in Comprehensive Editing},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: A substantial skill in comprehensive editing is the ability to
   write constructive comments to the author. This study provides a view
   into how students make comments during a comprehensive edit of a
   technical document.
   Method: Undergraduate technical editing students performed a
   comprehensive edit of a report. Data were derived from the editorial
   comments students made during the edit. Comments were coded for level of
   the comment (global, paragraph, or sentence), phrasing of the comment,
   and quality of the comment. A total of 132 comments were coded.
   Results: Both effective and ineffective commenting habits were observed.
   Students were found to make a high percentage of paragraph-level
   comments and a low percentage of global and sentence-level comments.
   Most of the comments were rated as useful to an author. Looking at
   specific problem areas, most students missed commenting on four major
   problems within the text. The students seemed to be using a linear
   editing style of simply moving through the document from beginning to
   end, rather than using a top-down editing style or multiple passes.
   Conclusions: When given instructions to perform a comprehensive edit,
   most students made comments that addressed global and paragraph-level
   issues, rather than sentence-level or copyediting issues. However, the
   overall quality and usefulness of the comments varied widely. As part of
   improving both writing and editing skills, technical communication
   pedagogy needs to focus more on overall document structure and how to
   structure sections within a document.},

Title = {Practicing Technical Communicators' Experiences with and Perspectives on
   Academic Publishing},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {29-55},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Most refereed journals in the field of technical communication
   have as a goal to publish research articles on problems, trends, and
   practices in the field to meet the needs of readers working in both
   industry and academia. But academic researchers and journal editors know
   little beyond anecdotal stories about what industry readers actually
   think about the research articles they read in the journals.
   Method: To better understand practitioner experiences with and
   perspectives on academic research, we conducted a 25-question survey of
   187 practicing technical communicators. Questions focused on experience
   with trade and academic publications; interest level in reading academic
   articles based on titles and abstracts; types of publications and
   content found most useful, valuable, and relevant; and suggested changes
   for how academic research is designed or reported.
   Results: The majority of respondents were either unfamiliar with or
   never or rarely read research published in the six main journals in the
   field. Common reasons given included difficulty finding and gaining
   access to journal articles, difficulty parsing practical applications,
   and difficulty making sense of dense and convoluted writing. But
   respondents also expressed strong interest in published research that
   has readily evident practical applications and relevance to current work
   practices.
   Conclusion: Academic research in the field has the potential to reach
   and impact much wider audiences. We offer specific suggestions for how
   journals, professional organizations, researchers, and practitioners can
   better promote and increase access to published research and increase
   its relevance, value, and accessibility for industry readers.},

Title = {The Profession of Technical Communication through the Lens of the STC
   India Chapter: Understanding Current Perspectives and Future Directions},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {26-44},

Abstract = {Purpose: India's community of technical communicators has grown steadily
   since the 1990s; however, scholarly research contains little about the
   experiences and needs of this community. We aim to enrich existing
   literature by sharing questionnaire results that begin to establish the
   state of the field in India. We discuss the way practitioners associated
   with the STC India chapter professionalize through education and
   training and innovate by experimenting with new genres and technologies.
   Method: We administered an online questionnaire with 32 questions among
   participants at the STC India conference in Bangalore; 76 people
   responded. The questionnaire asked about participants' professional
   backgrounds, vision for the future of TPC, and educational experiences.
   Data from the questionnaire, both qualitative and quantitative, was
   anonymized, coded, and evaluated.
   Results: The data suggest that practitioners in this study view their
   most significant role as writing and have high levels of content
   knowledge and experience with cross-cultural collaboration. They are
   educated in the technical and scientific fields but see themselves as
   lacking opportunities for university degrees in technical communication.
   Participants were aware of the constantly changing nature of the economy
   and workplaces and articulated how technical communication in India may
   be affected. The data illuminated the potential for improved
   cross-cultural partnerships in research and industry.
   Conclusion: Practitioners in this study possess high levels of education
   and understand the importance of change in technical communication. They
   are working to adapt and stay relevant in a rapidly changing field. The
   data suggest that these practitioners are seeking additional technical
   communication-specific training. More research is needed to understand
   the state of technical communication in India more broadly.},

Title = {``Filling to Capacity{''}: An Exploratory Study of Project Management
   Language in Agile Scrum Teams},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {169-180},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This exploratory study investigates the project management (PM)
   language used by Agile Scrum team members at a software development firm
   within their Scrum meetings.
   Method: The meetings from three sprints were audio-recorded and all
   spoken exchanges were transcribed. A codebook was developed to assess
   for meeting function PM language. A correspondence analysis assessed the
   association of Scrum meeting type and PM language.
   Results: The results of this exploratory study suggest that the Scrum
   team members use PM language in somewhat ritualized ways, particularly
   when some of the PM language is deployed. The correspondence analysis
   also suggests five associations between certain meeting types and
   certain PM language.
   Conclusion: This exploratory study provides a baseline of in situ
   Scrum-based project management upon which other studies may build, which
   may become useful as future studies may expand to include Kanban and
   Scrumban. It also suggests that while this Scrum-based group uses some
   PM language in expected ways (i.e., team maintenance is associated with
   kickoff meetings), other uses are unexpected (i.e., planning language is
   not associated with planning meetings). These differentiations from the
   ideal Scrum PM process suggest that future research is warranted.},

Title = {Web-Based Annual Reports at First Contact: Corporate Image and
   Aesthetics},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {282-296},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Enterprises aim for a favorable corporate image and use their
   corporate annual reports to impart it. The annual report is a formal
   document that fulfills the mandatory disclosure requirements and serves
   as an organization's mass communication medium to inform shareholders,
   investors, employees, customers, suppliers, and the press, as well as
   the general public. In particular, large enterprises provide an
   additional online version of their report. We investigated user
   engagement at first contact with such Web-based annual reports and the
   influence of main report characteristics-content, usability, and
   aesthetics-on corporate image and overall impressions.
   Method: In a Web-based study, 155 participants read one of eight online
   corporate annual reports from German companies. Corporate image was
   assessed before and after browsing the report, overall impression
   afterwards. The report characteristics content, usability, and
   aesthetics were measured with established and validated questionnaires.
   Results: Findings were in line with our hypotheses: Corporate image
   significantly improved from before to after reading a Web-based annual
   report, even as reading time was short, demonstrating a mere exposure
   effect. The report characteristics content, usability, and aesthetics
   explained 20.5\% of the variation in this increase and 66.0\% of the
   overall impression of the reports; the best predictor was visual
   aesthetics.
   Conclusion: Content features of corporate reports are often limited by
   legal requirements, and usability of online reports is mainly driven by
   users' demands. However, organizations can positively influence their
   public perception by improving the visual design of their annual reports
   online.},

Title = {Stories from the Secret City: Ray Smith's Art of Narrative as Rhetoric},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-26},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: To help readers better understand the craft and the rhetorical
   power of narrative as used in corporate and community settings-and to
   illustrate strategies that rhetorical storytellers may employ.
   Method: This article analyzes storytelling by means of a case study in
   the art of narrative as used in support of an organization, community,
   and industry. The organization is Y-12 National Security Complex, which
   makes parts for America's nuclear arsenal and does research and
   production in nuclear materials for medicine, biology, industry, and
   nuclear energy and propulsion. The community is Oak Ridge, Tennessee and
   environs. ``Industry{''} references the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge
   and beyond, including its partnership with the U.S. military. The
   subject of the case study-the person whose narrative art is here
   analyzed-is Ray Smith, official historian of Y-12. The material analyzed
   comes from publications by Smith, notes from interviews with him on
   multiple occasions, and many sessions of listening to his stories both
   in person and via recordings (documentaries, presentations available on
   web sites, etc.).
   Results: This study finds that Smith's stories connected with the
   Manhattan Project, and the years preceding and succeeding it, constitute
   a model set of narratives displaying the rhetorical power of
   storytelling in an organizational setting.
   Conclusion: By studying the ways narrative is successfully used in
   professional settings, we deepen our understanding of rhetorical
   storytelling as well as our ability to use it. This skill has wide
   application to contexts of technical and professional communication. It
   can be used to elevate public opinion about a corporation, community, or
   industry; to breed confidence among consumers and investors; to
   construct leadership models for managers; to inspire and motivate
   employees-and in virtually any other sort of rhetorical enterprise.},

Title = {Technical Communication as User Experience in a Broadening Industry
   Landscape},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {248-264},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Based on an analysis of 502 industry job postings, this article
   argues that technical communication work shares traits and competencies
   with the field of UX and that technical communicators who are not
   already doing UX work are well-qualified to expand their career paths
   into the UX field and could, in fact, play a central role in UX.
   Method: We analyzed 502 user experience job postings from Monster.com.
   After mining the postings for position title, job type, education level,
   experience level, location, salary, and industry sector, we conducted a
   content analysis of the job descriptions, using open coding to identify
   professional competencies and personal characteristics that employers
   are seeking in applicants, as well as key technologies and information
   products.
   Results: The user experience job postings could be grouped into five
   categories-Designer, Developer, Architect, Manager, Researcher-each with
   a distinct profile in terms of information products, technology skills,
   and professional competencies. However, the job postings also reflected
   skills, competencies, and characteristics that were common across job
   categories, and several of these are areas that overlap with more
   traditional technical communication positions.
   Conclusion: We articulate the advantages and challenges of transitioning
   into UX and make recommendations to help technical communication
   practitioners and programs capitalize on the advantages and address the
   challenges.},

Title = {Accounting for the Human Element When Planning for a Content Management
   System},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-111},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article assists technical communication professionals in
   planning, designing and implementing a content management system (CMS)
   in their organization. As my organization discovered, few resources
   exist explaining the considerations involved in such an initiative, and
   there was a noted lack of information to help us plan for human-based
   factors affecting its success. This article attempts to fill that gap by
   relating our experiences.
   Method: We first monitored the CMS to understand its use by our
   organization's authors. Next, we conducted a survey to understand their
   perceptions of the system. We then made changes to the system based on
   the answers gathered in the survey. Finally, we monitored the system's
   use once more after the changes were made.
   Results: Our study suggested that authors did not want to use the new
   system because they were insecure in using it, perceived it as too
   difficult to use, and were unfamiliar with the system (among other
   issues). We then implemented a more familiar interface, created a
   version control system allowing them to revert to previous versions if
   they made mistakes, and created and deployed Web-based video tutorials.
   Finally, we tracked a noted increase in the use of the system by our
   authors.
   Conclusion: Based on our experience, for future technical communicators
   considering a CMS, I suggest involving those affected as soon as
   possible, implementing tools that are familiar, providing multiple
   methods of training, and creating mechanisms to ease anxiety about
   mistakes and errors.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine how blogs reflect practitioner views of

   Method: Content analysis of 10 practitioner blogs, focusing on
   professional topics of status, education, professional societies, and
   the effects of technology.
   Results: Although the bloggers under study appear to function as an
   effective community of practice, they are not currently directing their
   actions or attention toward the traditional goals of
   professionalization, such as licensing and accreditation.
   Conclusions: The latent themes that emerge show that many of the goals
   of professionalizing (such as standardizing routes into the field and
   increasing respect for the work) are also concerns of practitioners.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Survey and anecdotal evidence indicates that universities do not prepare
   students well for writing in the workplace. One important reason for
   this failure is that rhetorical theory dominates the teaching of
   technical communication in the academy. Though extremely influential in
   the academy, rhetorical theory is inappropriate for teaching some kinds
   of important workplace communication (instructions, online
   documentation, computer-human interfaces, indexes), and it does not
   address important skills that practicing technical communicators need.
   Instrumental discourse differs from rhetoric in its purpose, in its
   absence of reasons and argumentation, in its task-oriented approach, in
   its emphasis on accessibility, and in its emphasis on economics. As a
   result, instrumental discourse is much more appropriate for the genres
   and skills that practicing technical communicators use, and it offers
   significant advantages to students, and in the long run, to the academy
   itself.},

Title = {Legitimizing Situated Knowledge in Rural Communities Through
   Storytelling Around Gas Pipelines and Environmental Risk},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {40-55},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this article is to demonstrate that rural landowners
   and community members' place-based, situated knowledge is expertise that
   should be taken into account by TPC professionals involved with
   technological or environmental development (e.g., in the energy sector).
   Method: This paper is grounded in the stories of 31 residents of rural
   West Virginia who share concerns about ongoing natural gas pipeline
   development. Through visual and place-based storytelling methods,
   walk-along interviews (Carpiano, 2009) and photovoice (Sullivan, 2017),
   a rich collection of stories and photographs that reveal the
   often-undocumented effects of pipeline development were gathered.
   Results: The stories of residents living in close proximity to natural
   gas pipelines reveal two main types of knowledge circulating in
   conversations about energy development: knowledge rooted in more
   traditional forms of epistemic authority, such as legal definitions and
   technical accounts of land; and situated knowledge derived from lived
   experiences of people directly impacted by technological and
   environmental changes.
   Conclusion: Ultimately, we argue that to embrace stories told by rural
   residents is to center the experiences of communities, which, in turn,
   legitimizes situated knowledge resulting from first-hand experience.
   This demonstrates that expertise can be located in spaces outside of
   corporate, technical, or academic knowledge, and encourages technical
   communicators to seek out that expertise in their own work.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This case history reports on the process of developing a method
   to identify, extract, and clean string citation data from a corpus of
   articles to assist future studies on research methods, especially those
   relating citation metrics to diversity and inclusion efforts in
   technical communication.
   Method: We developed a theory-to-query method that uses a theoretical
   framework, computer logic, and collaborative research design to create a
   custom computer program to extract data from a large corpus of text.
   This research method uses an iterative approach involving both human and
   computer analysis to complete the necessary tasks.
   Results: Although we successfully created a custom computer program to
   parse citations, both human and computer analysis were needed to
   effectively extract data from the corpus. The allocation of labor (human
   vs. computer) was driven by the limitations of the data as well as by
   the limitations of human and computer abilities, rather than the type of
   task (e.g., repetitive, requiring pattern recognition).
   Conclusion: Interdisciplinary partners should use a framework to
   communicate effectively in their design process to better refine a
   project's scope, overcome unexpected limitations, and troubleshoot.
   Theory-to-query is a method that combines theoretical frameworks,
   computer logic, and collaborative research design to create custom
   programs that aid analysis, such as designing a program for extracting
   citations from a corpus of journal articles. However, even with detailed
   plans and clear communication, design processes require iteration and
   creativity as new limitations for both human and computer analysis are
   identified.},

Title = {A Scheme for Understanding and Writing Summaries},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {45-60},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Writing a summary is not necessarily a straightforward task.
   Presented here is a scheme of twelve descriptors that reveals much of
   the complexity of summaries. The scheme can also serve as a design
   heuristic.
   Method: The scheme draws upon the psychology of text processing and
   applied linguistics, and derives theoretically from the intertextual
   relationship between the summary and the summarized text and the
   contrast between summary as microcosm (miniature of the summarized text)
   and the many ways in which summaries are not microcosmic.
   Results: The scheme consists of these twelve descriptors. The Purpose of
   the summary. The possibility of a Specification constraint that
   complicates the writing of the summary. Reduction, the length of a
   summary as a ratio of the summarized text. The Phrasing-informative or
   descriptive-of the summary. Proportion and Exclusion, how fully each
   part of the text is represented in the summary. Structure, how the ideas
   in the summary are arranged in relation to the text. Placement, where in
   relation to the text (before, after, within, alongside, or independent
   of) a summary (or multiple summaries) appears. Addition, the possibility
   of adding content not in the text to the summary. Authorship, whether
   the author of the text (or an associate) or someone not associated with
   the text wrote the summary. The Stance, Style, and Format of a summary.
   Conclusion: The scheme advances our understanding of summaries and,
   especially when used as a heuristic, can help technical communicators in
   their work. It may also be the basis of further research.},

Title = {Communally Designed Deception: Participatory Technical Communication
   Practices in an Amateur Game Design Community},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {257-271},

Abstract = {Purpose: As it is often difficult to study professional game design
   practices from a technical communication perspective, this exploratory
   study seeks to discover accessible alternatives in amateur communities
   engaged in participatory design.
   Methods: Using an exploratory, mixed methods single-case study model, we
   analyzed discourse and technical communication practices in a community
   focused on designing and playing social deception games across a network
   of digital platforms, with an eye toward how administrators, designers,
   and players negotiated design challenges.
   Results: The amateur game design community observed here participates in
   professional design practices that can be mapped onto Eyman's (2008)
   framework for technical communication in games. Communities such as the
   subject-participants in this study produce unique documentation tracing
   design processes in ways some professional studios do not (Sansone,
   2014) and foreground user experience considerations in observable,
   archived discussions.
   Conclusion: Amateur game design communities are as interested in
   maintaining strong user experiences and balanced gameplay as
   professional studios, as indicated by this study, and may use similar
   tactics to achieve results. The comparisons allowed construction of a
   framework for comparing amateur and professional designs in terms of
   tech comm practices. For technical communicators who must understand and
   account for world-making processes, demonstrating how amateur practice
   may compare to professional practice opens up new potential sites of
   study in the service of constructing game design ecologies.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: In 2014, a master's program in Content Strategy for
   professionals began at the Joanneum University of Applied Sciences in
   Graz. This is the first and, so far, the only master's program of this
   kind.
   Method: In this article, we present the master's program as a case
   study. We are dealing with the understanding of the concept of content
   conveyed in the degree program and with the didactic (pedagogical)
   approach. We analyze how our initial approach has proven its worth in
   practice and how we modified it. We interpret selected results of our
   experiences (e.g., the way to supervise the master theses).
   Results: We discuss these experiences based on the concepts of
   ``reflective practitioner{''} (as introduced by Donald Schon) and
   ``community of practice{''} (as introduced by Etienne Wenger). We
   investigate the relationships between implicit and explicit practical
   knowledge and the possibilities of teaching this knowledge to other
   practitioners.
   Conclusion: Content strategy can be taught and conceived as a reflective
   practice which is integrated into communities of practice.},

   Results: Technical communicators are functioning as agile, adaptable,
   and multi-specialists in a broad range of organizational functions. They
   have become increasingly visible and valuable assets throughout a
   project lifecycle, and in many cases are able to define their own roles,
   which include team leadership and management responsibilities.

Title = {The Minimalist Approach to Online Instructional Videos},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {131-146},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: The instructional project described in this article explores a
   model for re-conceptualizing a form of short video instruction manual
   termed here as the ``Web app video.{''} The goal is to determine whether
   explicit instruction in minimalism can help students (and practitioners)
   apply such principles and heuristics to the genre of Web app videos and
   aid in invention within emergent documentation scenarios.
   Method: An instructional method was used in this study, specifically the
   introduction of minimalist documentation concepts and heuristics to
   instructional video production. This study compares assessment rubrics
   completed by students as pre- and post-test assessment data, though the
   success of the instructional method is not dependent upon these results.
   Results: After working with minimalism heuristics, student-produced
   videos showed greater attention to imperative mood language,
   task-orientation, and error representation than existing videos for Web
   applications. Though student-produced videos lacked production polish,
   they showed evidence of minimalist strategies.
   Conclusions: Minimalist documentation strategies can be successfully
   taught and applied to short videos designed to entertain, encourage,
   inform, and instruct potential users while enabling them to engage the
   Web application with more knowledge.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine the elements of professional consciousness in
   technical communication to facilitate the growth of professional
   identity.
   Method: To develop a structured collaboration model based on Wenger's
   three dimensions for establishing a community of practice: joint
   enterprise, mutual engagement, and shared repertoire.
   Results: Structured collaboration shows strong potential to nurture a
   community in which the specific professional identity of being an
   academic or a practitioner is minimized in favor of the negotiated
   identity of being a community member working toward mutual goals.
   Conclusions: Effective collaboration between the academic and
   practitioner communities creates a negotiated professionalism through
   better research, better education, and a more comprehensive body of
   knowledge. Structured collaboration along the lines of community of
   practice can be used to encourage professional consciousness, which can
   lead to professional status.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-148},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose: This paper analyzes the PowerPoint handouts of 22 engineering
   undergraduate students to establish criteria for judging the persuasive
   capabilities of the students' visual argument in handouts that are
   expanded versions of PowerPoint slides used for presentations. Specific
   guidelines on how to create effective visual arguments that are useful
   as slides meant for presentations cannot be used as handouts.
   Method: The criteria were derived primarily from Doumont's (2002) three
   laws of professional communication that suggest how to combine
   rhetorical and visual elements to form coherent arguments.
   Results: The results show that Doumont's laws are helpful in judging the
   persuasiveness of the students' visual arguments. In addition, the
   weaknesses in the students' visual arguments applied to all three laws,
   which is in line with Doumont's view that the laws have an order of
   precedence.
   Conclusion: The guidelines in this paper can help practitioners convert
   their slides into handouts more effectively and encourage teachers to
   spend more time teaching visual argument in the classroom.},

Title = {Single Sourcing and Content Management: A Survey of STC Members},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {375-397},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: To gather reliable empirical data on (1) STC members' use of
   and attitudes toward single sourcing and/or content management (SS/CM)
   methods and tools; (2) factors perceived to be driving or impeding
   adoption of this technology; (3) transition experiences of adopting work
   groups; (4) perceived impacts of SS/CM methods and tools on efficiency,
   usability, customer focus, and job stress.
   Method: Cross-sectional sample survey of 1,000 STC members conducted in
   May 2008; multiple survey contacts by email with link to online survey
   instrument.
   Results: Of 276 respondents, half reported using SS/CM methods and
   tools. About 1 in 10 respondents reported experience with a failed
   implementation of SS/CM; half the SS/CM users reported significant
   downsides or tradeoffs. Perceived top drivers of SS/CM adoption were
   faster development, lower costs, regulatory and compliance pressures,
   and translation needs. About 1 in 9 respondents used Darwin Information
   Typing Architecture (DITA). Large company size made use of SS/CM
   significantly more likely, and work groups using single sourcing with
   content management were significantly larger than work groups of other
   SS/CM subgroups and non-users of SS/CM. Single sourcing without content
   management seems destined to achieve a larger proportion of adopters
   than single sourcing with content management, barring a technology
   breakthrough. Among all respondents, Microsoft Word and FrameMaker were
   the most-used primary authoring tools.
   Conclusions: With regard to these methods and tools, STC members appear
   to be in the Early Majority phase of Everett M. Rogers's innovation
   adoption curve. Diffusion of these methods and tools appeared to have
   been steady in the five years prior to the survey, with no dramatic
   increase in more recent pace of adoption.},

Title = {Twitter as a Technical Communication Platform: How IT Companies' Message
   Characteristics Relate to Online Engagement},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {18-35},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Twitter is a promising technical communication platform for
   companies, but a thorough understanding of how it works best is lacking.
   This study analyzes characteristics of IT companies' technical
   communication tweets and relates them to users' online engagement
   (likes, retweets, replies). Three message characteristics were included:
   content, message elements, and communication strategies. Method: We
   collected technical communication tweets posted by four IT companies in
   two weeks (N = 1,604). We developed a content categorization and also
   coded the tweets for message elements, communication strategies, and
   online engagement. Message elements and communication strategies were
   compared with those used in the companies' corporate and marketing
   communication tweets. Negative binomial regression analyses were used to
   map relationships between message characteristics and online engagement.
   Results: Ten content types were distinguished, illustrating the
   versatile nature of technical communication on Twitter. Hyperlinks were
   the most prominent message element; two types of elements were less
   prevalent: elements enhancing attractiveness (photos, videos, emojis)
   and elements connecting to a broader Twitter discourse (hashtags,
   mentions). Communication strategies did not include community-building
   tweets; evoking action was most prominent. Several links were found
   between message characteristics and online engagement: Providing user
   instructions or updates and feedback opportunities, including photos or
   videos, and providing one-way information promoted online engagement.
   Conclusion: Although Twitter might work differently for technical
   communication than for other domains, it seems fruitful to add more
   attractive message elements and explore community-building strategies
   within technical communication. However, there is also reason to
   relativize the importance of online engagement indicators for technical
   communication.},

Title = {mHealth Apps and Usability: Using User-Generated Content to Explore
   Users' Experiences with a Civilian First Responder App},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study uses a qualitative content analysis approach to
   analyze existing user-generated content (UGC) for a civilian first
   responder mobile health or mHealth app, PulsePoint Respond. We argue
   that online review comments for these apps, the type of UGC we analyzed,
   can provide a rich source of untapped data for practitioners working in
   UX. We offer a UGC commenting heuristic that can help practitioners more
   effectively identify users' functional and productive usability
   concerns.
   Method: We analyzed review comments (n=599) about PulsePoint Respond
   posted on the iOS platform between September 2016 and November 2019.
   Using open card sorting for data reduction, we eliminated 307 comments.
   We then created preliminary codes for the remaining 292 comments and
   used affinity diagramming to discuss, define, and finalize categories in
   order to analyze the final sample.
   Results: We created a total of 14 categories, including ``Unusable{''}
   or not actionable comments (307) and comments that were classified as
   ``Multiple Categories{''} (45). The remaining 12 categories included
   Accurate Notifications (28), Audio (49), Compatibility and Integrations
   (8), Currency (58), Improvements (49), Location (27), More Agencies
   (50), Naming and Descriptions (41), Operating System/Battery/Memory (6),
   Privacy (4), Updates (8), and Usability/Interface (23).
   Conclusion: We found that functional usability considerations remain
   important for users. However, many users also commented on the
   limitations of particular functionalities and/or described actions they
   sought to perform that were not supported by the app. Drawing from our
   analysis, we propose a UGC commenting heuristic that can help
   practitioners more effectively identify users' functional and productive
   usability concerns.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Pages = {56-72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Screen-capture video is an increasingly popular vehicle for
   communicating information online. We posit that screen-capture video
   represents a distinct genre of technical communication, which leverages
   a specific set of formal features to communicate information to viewers.
   We propose and evaluate an initial catalog of formal features, grouping
   them in four categories: attention cues, segmentation cues, content
   features, and vocal performance.
   Method: To evaluate our catalog, we completed a systematic survey of the
   features of 200 screen-capture tutorial videos from YouTube.
   Results: We found that many of the features in our catalog are already
   being leveraged by screen-capture creators and, further, that use of
   these features is correlated with video viewership.
   Conclusion: We provide a practical catalog of formal features that
   screen-capture creators use to effectively convey information to
   viewers, and demonstrate that these features are predictive of video
   viewership. Further, our results suggest that certain features, like
   vocal performance and segmentation cues, are especially predictive of
   viewership.},

Title = {An Analysis of Physical and Rhetorical Characteristics of Videos Used to
   Promote Technology Projects, on the Kickstarter Crowdfunding Platform},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {319-346},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article examines physical and rhetorical characteristics
   of videos used to promote technology projects on Kickstarter. In this
   study, successful projects are defined as projects that reached their
   funding goal; failed projects did not meet their funding goal.
   Method: Content analysis of 25 successful and 25 failed technology
   project videos. Cross-cultural analysis of successful U.S. videos and
   non-U.S. videos.
   Results:
   Successful project videos were more likely to include iconic and
   analytic still images and to demonstrate the final product; usually
   displayed a combination of static and dynamic pictures; and tended to
   use shorter on-screen texts.
   All videos comprised at least one of the kairos subtypes.
   Successful U.S. videos were more likely to present the creator onscreen,
   include static pictures and provide information on why the creator
   needed donations (logos). These also always referred to timeliness or a
   call to action (kairos).
   Successful non-U.S. videos were much more likely to refer to the
   exclusivity of the product (pathos)
   Conclusion: Kickstarter project videos are an important feature on the
   main project page and may influence potential supporters' decisions to
   fund projects. While other factors can also contribute to project
   success, an awareness of physical characteristics and rhetorical appeals
   of successful videos can help project campaigners, technical
   communication practitioners, and educators create more effective videos.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This mixed-methods case study identified workplace
   communication practices of novice engineers and the perceptions of their
   managers.
   Method: The study design employed convergent parallel mixed methods to
   identify common themes. Qualitative data were collected through
   open-form survey questions, diary/activity logs with follow-up
   semi-structured interviews, and contextual inquiry methods. Quantitative
   data were collected through surveys with Likert-rating scales and choice
   questions. Data were collected using three sources (novice engineer,
   engineering manager, researcher) to triangulate methods and consisted of
   a macro-study, with 12 participant engineer/manager pairings, and a
   micro-study, with 4 pairings.
   Results: During data analysis, a major theme that emerged was project
   management communication activities, such as planning project
   activities, providing or soliciting updates on project activities,
   coordinating or facilitating a meeting or training session, and
   documenting and disseminating meeting discussions. Managers provide
   constructive criticism to novice engineers regarding their communication
   abilities. Specific themes were needing to (1) provide `big picture'
   context prior to technical details; (2) develop clear, appropriate
   written and visual content; (3) provide confident, timely content to the
   audience; and (4) increase interactions with technicians and operators.
   Conclusions: Novice engineers fit into a technical and social context
   and communicate as project managers. These communications and activities
   are not reserved only for more experienced engineers. Additional
   research with novice engineers and project management communication
   activities would be helpful, including an analysis of the training and
   support needed to be effective communicators as project managers.},

Title = {Effects of Communicating with Emails and Texts in Risk Communication:
   Information Poor, Writer-Based, A-Synchronous},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {194-209},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article examines how electronic messaging may have
   affected communication between engineers and managers during three
   crisis situations-the Columbia shuttle breakup, the BP/Horizon oil rig
   explosion, and the Skokie, IL, landslide.
   Method: A rhetorical analysis was conducted of email messages written
   during the three crisis situations. The analysis was based on previous
   studies which indicate that writers of electronic messages provide
   insufficient information, compose writer-rather than reader-based texts,
   and use inappropriate formats for communicating complex or controversial
   issues.
   Results: A failure to include sufficient information characterized a
   number of the email messages sent prior to the BP/Horizon explosion.
   Writer-rather than reader-based messages were written prior to the
   BP/Horizon explosion as well as during the Columbia breakup. Some of
   these messages included personal and irrelevant information as well as
   social media conventions conflated with business formats. Various
   BP/Horizon oil rig messages were also often communicated in an
   inappropriate format for discussing complex and controversial
   information. On the other hand, email messages sent following the Skokie
   landslide appear to be reader-based, contain no personal or irrelevant
   information, are free of social media conventions, and provide responses
   in a timely manner.
   Conclusion: Had writers in the BP explosion and the Columbia breakup
   written reader-based texts as well as recognized the asynchronous nature
   of electronic communication, their messages may have been more
   effective.},

Title = {Implications of Desnoyers' Taxonomy for Standardization of Data
   Visualization: A Study of Students' Choice and Knowledge},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {193-208},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Current research on data visuals focuses on their creation and
   use; however, there are few attempts at standardizing data visuals to
   help facilitate better interdisciplinary communication. Can Desnoyers'
   taxonomy facilitate better interdisciplinary communication in STEM (
   Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields by helping
   practitioners choose more efficient data visuals? In addition, would
   adopting Desnoyers' taxonomy bypass the current discrepancies between
   academic and journal data visuals?
   Methods: To test Desnoyers' taxonomy's impact on efficient use of data
   visuals, I did an exploratory, pretest/posttest survey of 101 STEM
   students and their choices of data visuals before and after exposure to
   Desnoyers' taxonomy.
   Results: Students chose more complex and more efficient data visuals on
   the posttest, after exposure to Desnoyers' taxonomy. However, level in
   school did not change the effect of exposure.
   Conclusion: Students' reported use of data visuals supports prior
   research about discrepancies between academic and journal data visuals.
   Additionally, students might benefit from having more exposure and
   training in efficient data visuals. Further control group studies are
   needed to show if Desnoyers' taxonomy itself can increase students'
   comprehension and use of efficient data visuals as compared to pure
   explanation of data visuals. If the further studies demonstrate that,
   then researchers and creators in the field of data visualization could
   confidently adopt Desnoyers' taxonomy as a way to teach and reference
   data visuals consistently.},

Title = {Writing for the Participants of International Clinical Trials: Law,
   Ethics, and Culture},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {266-281},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Regulatory authorities and health care practitioners
   participating in international clinical trials are often discussed in
   the technical writing literature. However, the most vulnerable
   audience-the participants-is left out of the conversation. The purpose
   of this article is to examine the influence of legal and cultural
   contexts on participant-directed informed consent documentation. Such
   examination will help technical communicators make informed consent
   documentation more user-centered.
   Method: Using excerpts from informed consents that I translated into
   Russian, examples from my six years as a localization specialist, and an
   overview of contradictory U.S., Russian, and international laws, I
   analyze the legal, ethical, and cultural considerations for informed
   consent documentation in international clinical trials.
   Results: The results of this analysis show that international
   regulations often differ from U.S. and Russian laws. In addition, the
   culture and way of life in the country where a clinical trial originates
   (e.g., the United States) might differ from those in the country where
   the trials are conducted (e.g., Russia). These differences influence the
   comprehension of information in informed consent documentation and a
   patient's decision to take part in a clinical trial. Technical
   communicators are often responsible for the difficult task of
   reconciling the contradictory issues raised in international clinical
   trial legislation, differences in legal systems of particular countries,
   and tensions between law and culture.
   Conclusion: I offer strategies that technical communicators can adapt to
   work in the best interests of their audience and to present
   user-centered information in informed consent documentation.},

Abstract = {Style manuals sponsored by professional associations in various
   scientific disciplines have received virtually no scholarly attention.
   These manuals, however, specify many disciplinary discourse norms that
   writers need to follow in publishing scientific research. Consequently,
   these manuals provide an important and reliable source of information
   about how communities of working scientists conceptualize, construct,
   and publish their scientific texts. The disciplinary norms that these
   style manuals promulgate derive both from general scientific research
   practices and from the practical demands of scientific publishing.
   Because of their unique normative nature and their connection with
   scientific practice, disciplinary style manuals should be categorized
   separately from other types of scientific style manuals, and the
   material they contain can reliably be used in technical writing and
   editing.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study examines the value of requiring online master's
   students in technical and professional communication (TPC) to design and
   conduct an independent research (IR) project as part of degree
   completion. Given that IR is a requirement in only a small percentage of
   TPC programs nationally, I wanted to discern IR's value academically and
   in terms of applicable workplace skills, the benefits and challenges of
   conducting workplace-situated IR, and IR best practices.
   Method: I conducted focus groups with faculty and surveyed alumni,
   students, and advisory board members to analyze IR perceptions.
   Results: Respondents indicated that IR is an important intellectual
   outcome and desirable workplace skillset. Additional benefits include
   more ready engagement by students in workplace-situated IR and the
   potential to address workplace communication problems. Challenges
   involved gaining permission for a study, communicating IR
   recommendations to industry stakeholders via the academic thesis genre,
   and implementing workplace change based on IR results. IR best practices
   included embedding IR throughout coursework, providing sufficient
   resources, establishing a schedule, working with an advisor, and
   cultivating peer support.
   Conclusion: IR's academic and professional value needs to be better
   communicated to prospective and current students, faculty, and industry
   stakeholders. Students need guided opportunities to reflect on IR's
   value to them as students and professionals, and they should have
   opportunities throughout coursework to identify an IR topic and build on
   it. More resources and opportunities for peer-to-peer IR support need to
   be developed as well as an alternate IR deliverable, more conducive to
   communicating research results to industry.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: As digital media continue to proliferate into every aspect of
   our lives, sound is playing an ever-increasing role in the conveyance of
   information. Because digital messages via the Internet, cell phones,
   smart devices, and personal devices are typically shorter and more
   direct than traditional text-based communication, digital communication
   will necessarily improve via other, less textual cues. Visually, we
   already see this through the use of digital cues, such as emojis and
   graphical displays (e.g., GPS charts). But digital communication, in the
   future, will gain much from the expanded use of sound. As yet, no
   analytical framework for classifying sound in technical communication
   has been established.
   Method: The author revisits some historical uses of sound in technical
   communication before proposing a model for analyzing current and future
   sounds.
   Results: Tools that encompass signaling, linguistics, paralinguistics,
   extralinguistics, and rhetoric can be used to analyze complex sonic
   combinations and to generate new sounds for technical communication.
   Conclusions: A first model is proposed along with recommendations for
   the future.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Fluid team dynamics, pressures for shortening temporal cycles,
   and ever shifting configurations of work pose fundamental challenges for
   workers in project based organizations (PBOs). Since project work is
   episodic, project professionals rarely have opportunity to reflect
   across projects to identify potential organizational, social, or
   tool-based contradictions affecting their work. Given these challenges,
   an opportunity exists for technical communicators to leverage skills in
   communication analysis and modeling to aid project professionals with
   reflective exercises.
   Method: We propose an Activity Theory framework to analyze and model
   email communications generated during a project lifecycle to help
   technical communicators identify emerging contradictions and provide
   reflective feedback loops for project workers. Using the Enron corpus,
   we offer a case study detailing the construction of a reflective
   activity-centric model for project workers.
   Results: Our case study provides empirical evidence that
   activity-centric models can be constructed using email and attachments
   when organized by the five process groups outlined in the Project
   Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). Sample modeling and questions
   derived from the work offers examples for reflective engagement with
   project professionals.
   Conclusion: Activity-centric models derived from email records offer
   technical communicators an approach to identifying contradictions within
   and across projects. Resulting models and reflective exercises can
   support project professionals with feedback loops aimed at improving how
   they understand their work and the collective culture in which it is
   produced.},

Title = {An Integrative Literature Review of Project Management in Technical and
   Professional Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {85-106},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article presents the results of an integrative literature
   review on project management in technical and professional
   communication. The goal of the article is to demonstrate how project
   management has been discussed and studied by the field. By analyzing the
   field's approach to project management, the article sets groundwork for
   research, pedagogies, and best practices that prepare technical and
   professional communicators to shape effective project management
   practices.
   Method: To achieve this goal, we assembled a sample of 326 sources
   across academic and practitioner publishing venues from the years
   2005-2016. To comprise the sample, we used targeted keyword searches to
   identify published work that addressed project management in technical
   and professional communication.
   Results: Project management in technical and professional communication
   is often presented as an adjacent practice to other concepts or
   practices, such as leadership or documentation management. Additionally,
   project management is described or discussed primarily in terms of
   skills and relationships established through concepts such as teaming,
   collaboration, professional communication, communication theory, and
   education.
   Conclusion: The limited characterization of project management in the
   existing research creates the opportunity for technical and professional
   communicators (TPCs) to explicitly acknowledge the complexity of project
   management from a rhetorical perspective. The outcome of this rhetorical
   approach would position TPCs to develop and shape ethical and
   audience-focused PM practices through their communication expertise.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Increasingly, technical communicators need to develop materials
   that meet the usability expectations of audiences in different nations
   and from different cultures. This article presents a research approach
   technical communicators can use to better understand and design
   materials for the different contexts in which individual in other
   nations use a given technology or communication product.
   Method: I review how an understanding of the context in which
   individuals use an item (i.e., context of use) affects what constitutes
   usability in a setting. I then review how script theory (from cognitive
   psychology) and prototype theory (from linguistics) can be combined to
   create an effective method for identifying the variables affecting use
   in different cultural contexts.
   Results: A focused application of script theory can provide technical
   communicators with a framework for identifying the variables affecting
   usability in different cultural contexts. Such identification can be
   enhanced by a targeted application of prototype theory, and technical
   communicators can use a combination of script theory and prototype
   theory to develop communication products more attuned to different
   cultural contexts of use.
   Conclusion: When combined in a focused way, a script-prototype theory
   approach to researching the context of use in other cultures can help
   technical communicators better understand such contexts and design
   materials that better meet the expectations of users in other cultures.},

Title = {Web-Based Crowd Funding: Rhetoric of Success},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-24},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: To identify the main rhetorical techniques actually used to
   secure investors' support in some of the most successful (most-funded)
   Web-based crowd funding projects. The study serves to bridge the gap
   between theoretical research of rhetoric and the needs of business
   communication practitioners by identifying the means of persuasion that
   can be used by online crowd funding entrepreneurs.
   Method: Qualitative analysis of thirteen crowd funding project
   descriptions posted on a major Web site-www.kickstarter.com-was
   performed to identify specific rhetorical techniques via text coding.
   The sample included the most-funded projects to date, one from each of
   the thirteen project categories on Kickstarter. Aristotle's concept of
   ethos, pathos, and logos served as a basic framework for developing a
   more detailed classification of rhetorical means of persuasion used in
   the projects.
   Results: The most-funded projects have been found to contain all three
   types of rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, and logos), subdivided into
   a total of twelve specific subtypes most commonly encountered in the
   descriptions from the sample. The subtype definitions have been
   developed and refined over the course of several reviews.
   Conclusion: The research data made it possible to create a ``rhetorical
   profile{''} of a successful crowd funding project description
   representing a summary of the rhetorical techniques identified during
   the study. Although this summary reflects a hypothetical all-inclusive
   case, it can be used as a benchmark when drafting crowd funding project
   descriptions. The study also identified specific directions for future
   research that could determine the influence of project description
   rhetoric on donor decisions.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To develop and present a systematic, hierarchical taxonomy of

   as well as selection and design of visuals.
   Methods: Iterative analysis of commonly used visuals and existing
   typologies and selection of a classification system.
   Results: A taxonomy is proposed based on Linnean principles, which
   distinguishes three classes of visuals based on their information and
   sign content; these are subdivided in orders and families. A systematic
   nomenclature is described.
   Conclusions: Used successfully in training sessions and research, the
   taxonomy offers the basis for the development of comprehensive
   guidelines and improvements in the design and usage of visuals.},

Title = {Inform or Persuade? An Analysis of Technical Communication Textbooks},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {29-41},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: We examined how 10 best-selling technical communication
   textbooks delineated ``informative{''} and ``persuasive{''} purposes in
   discourse and, in response, suggest a more effective pedagogical
   alternative to this typical division that instead consistently
   emphasizes the rhetorical nature of all communication.
   Method: We conducted a semantic analysis of 10 best-selling technical
   communication textbooks and present findings regarding the appearance of
   terms related to ``informative{''} and ``persuasive{''} concepts in
   three types of documents or genres: general discussions, reports, and
   presentations. To demonstrate the problematic findings in these books,
   we also examine and summarize recent literature in rhetoric and
   technical communication.
   Results: Overall, a delineation of some sort between ``informative{''}
   and ``persuasive{''} communication was typically present, which-as
   literature in rhetoric and technical communication shows-contradicts
   practitioners' roles as persuasive communicators. While some of the
   examined textbooks emphasized persuasion in their general discussions,
   this emphasis became inconsistent when they discussed oral
   presentations, and the genre of report-writing in particular lacked
   discussion about its persuasive elements.
   Conclusion: We recommend a more complex, rhetorical, and consistent
   understanding of discourse that rejects an artificial divide between
   ``informative{''} and ``persuasive{''} in future technical communication
   textbooks and editions, especially in regard to all workplace
   communication.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Purpose: In light of widening, popular distrust of electoral systems,
   the question of how to improve confidence in voting has become
   especially timely and important. Complicating the issue are emerging
   technologies that threaten to ``blackbox{''} and obscure the function of
   voting systems. In addition to discussing the longstanding issue of
   trust in voting technology, this article provides a review of useful
   macro-scale concepts for practitioners to consider when working on
   projects related to electoral systems.
   Method: After providing a synthesis and overview of the broad principles
   of electoral integrity, I overview blockchain (the technology underlying
   Bitcoin), discuss its possible application to voting systems, and
   consider its implications for the broader goal of fostering voter trust
   and legitimacy.
   Results: Technologies such as blockchain have the potential to not only
   change the mechanics of voting but to change the very definitions of
   ``transparent{''} and ``trustworthy{''} as applied to election systems.
   Conclusion: Trust in elections systems is ultimately a rhetorical,
   rather than technical, effect. As technical communicators are
   increasingly called upon to ``unblackbox{''} election technologies, they
   must remain attentive to the potentially shifting values that define
   trustworthiness for the electorate at certain historical moments.},

   Knowledge Sharing Practices on Blogs},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {328-345},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: To empirically examine and document knowledge sharing patterns
   that practitioners employ in blog conversations about research and work
   experiences.
   Method: We conducted an empirical analysis of 235 blog posts from June
   2014 to March 2016. We analyzed and coded each post for 14 unique
   variables including article type, topic, and citation style. We then
   analyzed the data using both descriptive and inferential statistics in
   order to reveal patterns in the data.
   Results: An overwhelming majority of the blog posts were written by
   practitioners for practitioners. Of the 235 blog posts, the most common
   topics were technology, professionalization, and communication
   strategies. Of the technology posts written, DITA was by far the most
   common technology topic. The most common article types were
   argumentative, process, and how-to articles. While practitioners rarely
   blog about research, when they do, they spend most of their time writing
   about results and discussion as opposed to introductions or methodology.
   Finally, our analysis revealed that bloggers made intentional visual
   design choices when sharing knowledge via blogs.
   Conclusion: Practitioners use distinct knowledge dissemination patterns
   in blog conversations that shape how research is presented to the
   technical communication community. Understanding these patterns is an
   important first step toward developing a shared language that will help
   bridge the gap in understanding between the academic and practitioner
   communities. Ultimately, blogs are a useful forum for studying
   practitioner conversations and developing broader understanding about
   what they value in their work and research.},

Title = {Speakers and Boards: A Survey of Instructional Video Styles in MOOCs},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-115},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This paper offers an account of the current usage of
   communication styles and features in MOOC instructional videos. The aim
   of the study is to provide a better understanding of instructional video
   patterns and typologies and to find associations between video style
   usage and course attributes such as the MOOC platform and course
   subjects.
   Method: Five global, generalist MOOC platforms were selected for this
   study, which was conducted in two phases: First, a qualitative survey
   was made to identify frequently used video styles and build a
   classification scheme. Second, a sample of 115 courses in the selected
   MOOC platforms was used to account for video features and style
   frequencies. Various statistical tests were performed to discover
   associations between course characteristics and video style usage.
   Results: Seven video styles were identified as the most frequent in MOOC
   courses. They fully describe the video stock of 85\% of the sampled
   courses. A typical course uses two different styles. The study reveals
   two broad competing approaches to display instructional contents in MOOC
   videos: speaker-centric (a visible person speaks the contents) and
   board-centric (a large rectangular surface displays the contents). The
   actual usage of each approach is significantly related to the course
   subject area: Arts and humanities courses exhibit a preference for
   speaker-centric styles, while engineering and hard science courses favor
   board-centric videos. Social sciences and health courses are more
   neutral.
   Conclusion: Current MOOCs are focused on few representational styles,
   with speakers and boards as the two main models. The observed usage is
   consistent with a strong attachment to the lecture as an instructional
   technique.},

Title = {Translation as a User-Localization Practice},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {271-284},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article presents translation as a user-localized activity.
   Using Sun's (2012) distinction between user and practitioner
   localization, the researchers present a preliminary illustration of how
   translation is enacted by multilingual participants aiming to translate
   words from their heritage languages into English.
   Method: As part of this pilot study, ten, ten-minute interviews were
   conducted, video-recorded, and coded to better understand how
   multilingual users adapt information from their heritage languages into
   English.
   Results: Results suggest that users employ several strategies when
   translating in context: acting, comparing/contrasting, deconstructing,
   gesturing, intonation, negotiating, sketching, and storytelling. These
   strategies involve the use of both words and other semiotic resources
   (for example, gestures, intonation) to convey meaning across languages.
   Conclusion: Technical communication researchers and practitioners could
   develop more effective translation and localization frameworks by
   learning from the user-localized translation practices of multilinguals.
   Analyzing the translation practices of multilinguals who are not
   professional translators or interpreters could provide a framework for
   technical communicators to better recognize the complexities of writing
   in English for international audiences.},

Title = {Technically Speaking: Preservice Teachers' Perspectives and Attitudes on
   the Use of Technology},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {257-268},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Computer-based presentations are the expected form of
   instruction in education; however, little knowledge exists about
   perspectives and attitudes on the use of technology and technical
   communication in the classroom through preservice teachers' experiences.
   Therefore, the focus in our explorative study is to understand these
   perspectives and attitudes to aid in the development of technology and
   technical communication curriculums for preservice teachers.
   Method: A phenomenological research approach was used to interview ten
   preservice teachers to explore the question, ``what is the nature of
   preservice teachers' experiences with technology and technical
   communication in the classroom?{''}
   Results: Preservice teachers' educational experiences with technology
   and technical communication show a strong preference for using Microsoft
   PowerPoint to convey course content. However, a major theme from their
   perspectives and attitudes was negative toward formal PowerPoint
   communication training. Furthermore, participants stressed the over
   reliance on PowerPoint in the classroom; they desired more creativity
   and better ways of communicating course content.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence worthy of serious reflection on
   the reality that there is a significant issue in teacher education
   curriculum today and the ineffective use and instruction of technology
   and technical communication in educational settings.},

Title = {Using Business Models to Describe Technical Communication Groups},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {124-147},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: According to the management literature, a business model
   explains how an organization makes money (generates revenue). These
   models not only affect revenue but, because generating revenue is
   central to the survival of an organization, affects all other
   operations.
   Method: Applies the theory of business models from the management
   literature to technical communication groups, using descriptions of
   technical communication groups from empirical studies to identify the
   most common business models for these groups and suggests how the source
   of revenue affects operations.
   Results: Technical communication groups typically fall into one of these
   models: (a) Venture Capital Model-groups that produce content published
   for sale; (b) Design Model-groups that design the architecture and
   oversee implementation of Web sites, large information campaigns, user
   interfaces, and designed-in information; (c) Agency Model-groups that
   produce marketing communication, employee communication, and other high
   profile content; (d) Development Shop Model-groups that support a
   strategic effort by developing help, user's guides, reference manuals,
   and similar product information; (e) Technical Support Model-groups that
   produce materials for internal users; and (f) Contractor Model-groups
   that update documentation for products and services have long life
   cycles (often lasting for decades). Although the literature on technical
   communication advocates for the Design model, most technical
   communication groups operate under the Development Shop, Technical
   Support, and Contracting Models, as well as mixed models.
   Conclusions: This theory does not prescribe actions technical
   communication groups should take to change their status; rather it
   describes why technical communication groups in different organizations
   might have different experiences.},

Title = {Effects of Visual Signaling in Screenshots: An Eye Tracking Study},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {396-411},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Screenshots are an important means of visualization in software
   documentation. One question technical communicators need to address when
   dealing with screenshots is whether visual signaling elements, such as
   arrows or frames, should be added in order to highlight relevant
   information. This article reports the results of an experimental study
   that examined whether signaling elements successfully guide visual
   attention of readers to relevant screenshot information as intended. A
   second goal was to find out whether visual signaling has a positive
   impact on how accurate and fast users execute the tasks which the
   screenshots support.
   Method: Two versions of a software tutorial were constructed that
   included screenshots with or without signaling elements. Participants'
   eye movements were recorded while they studied the tutorial and executed
   the tasks described therein. In addition to eye movement measures,
   accuracy of task execution and time to complete the tasks were
   determined as measures of overall success on the tasks.
   Results: Participants working with tutorials that used visual signaling
   executed more tasks correctly. No differences were found regarding the
   time needed to complete the tasks. Analysis of the eye tracking data
   showed that participants fixated relevant screenshot areas longer and
   more often if highlighted by signaling elements.
   Conclusions: The results provide evidence that adding signaling elements
   to screenshots is an effective means to guide the visual attention of
   users. As predicted by the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning,
   visual signaling does not simply increase interest in pictures but helps
   users to select relevant information.},

Title = {Expository Warnings in Public Recreation and Tourism Spaces},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {347-362},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Every day, people are exposed to risks they either do not know
   exist or do not understand how to avoid. This is especially true in
   locations where the public may not expect or understand the danger
   around them-such as amusement parks, national parks, or unfamiliar
   vacation spots. Although a number of factors influence the effectiveness
   of a warning, this study focuses specifically on the use of expository
   versus abridged language in warning signs.
   Method: This research was conducted in two phases. First, I distributed
   an online survey that was completed by 303 participants who were
   randomly assigned to view one of two warning sign options and then were
   asked to describe the sign's meaning. Second, I conducted a content
   analysis of the survey responses using coding terms (related to Bloom's
   Taxonomy) to assess the levels of understanding that resulted from the
   two warning sign versions.
   Results: My findings indicate that people who viewed a longer, more
   detailed expository warning from a national park were more likely to
   understand the risks and consequences as well as how to apply the
   information to new situations or specific actions. In other words, they
   demonstrated a higher level of understanding risks and risk avoidance.
   Conclusions: In public recreation and tourism spaces, detailed
   expository warning signs may be more effective at helping the public
   understand unfamiliar risks and how to avoid them. However, reading
   times (max. 30 seconds) and contexts (near resting/standing areas)
   should be considered.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This research contributes to the scholarship in technical
   communication on race by furthering work regarding latinidad and
   technical documentation.
   Method: This article looks specifically at the 2017 Texas court case
   involving the 2011 district map involving districts 23 and 35. The
   article also analyzes the methods with which legislative mapmakers
   operate and deploy GIS software.
   Results: As previous researchers have noted, latinidad is often
   constructed in political and governmental documents within the United
   States to position Latinos as a threat to White Americans. Frequently,
   this constructed threat is mitigated by inflating the contributions of
   White Americans over their Latino counterparts. Yet, this examination of
   the 2017 court case illustrates that mapmakers can also utilize
   Geographic Information Systems to gerrymander districts and thus
   suppress Latino's voting power to help White Americans maintain
   political power. Most worrisome is mapmakers' deference to and citation
   of the Voting Rights Act to justify the creation of districts that
   account for and control electoral agency.
   Conclusion: The article concludes by asserting that technical
   communicators move beyond compliance in order to account for
   multicultural publics and to avoid engaging in similar technological
   practices. It also encourages technical communicators to become more
   active in identifying practices that threaten democratic integrity and
   in using their skills to promote more socially equitable electoral
   practices across their teaching, research, and advocacy.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article investigates technical/professional communication
   job postings in two non-US markets in order to develop an evidence-based
   understanding of the ways in which job requirements and responsibilities
   may differ from those in the US.
   Method: We analyzed 474 job postings in India and the United
   Kingdom/Ireland. We conducted a content analysis of the postings, coding
   for information products, technologies, professional competencies, and
   personal characteristics. We compared postings to postings for the US,
   utilizing ANOVA and CHI square measures to evaluate whether differences
   in the data were meaningful.
   Results: The study reveals substantial variation regarding employer
   expectations. US postings are characterized by higher experience levels
   and more qualifications than postings for the international markets,
   with greater focus on user documentation and reports, working with SMEs,
   usability/testing, technology, and personal characteristics. The Indian
   postings are the most distinct from the US positions, with differing
   experience levels and emphasis on what qualifications are important.
   Conclusion: The study emphasizes a need for greater understanding of
   international technical communication and the ways outsourcing may
   impact career choices. The variation across markets suggests that we
   cannot assume standard practices in the US transcend linguistic,
   geographical, and cultural boundaries. This is important both for
   meeting the challenges of outsourcing and for international
   collaborations more broadly. The study also highlights the need for
   curricula to address the complexities of a global workplace by providing
   students with both technical communication and intercultural
   competencies.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article extends earlier studies examining the core
   competencies of technical communicators. Our project updates these
   previous perspectives by analyzing the broad range of information
   products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal traits
   requested by industry job advertisements. The analysis seeks to answer
   three main questions:
   What genre/information product knowledge is important for success in the
   technical communication job market?
   What technology skills are essential for success in the technical
   communication job market?
   What professional competencies and personal characteristics are
   essential for success in the technical communication job market?
   Method: We analyzed almost 1,000 U.S. technical communication job
   postings from Monster. com. We mined the postings for position title,
   job type, education level, experience level, location, salary, and
   industry sector. We subsequently conducted a content analysis of the job
   descriptions, using open coding to identify information products,
   technologies, professional competencies, and personal characteristics.
   Results: The job postings exhibited enormous variety in position titles
   but fell into five main categories: Content Developer/Manager,
   Grant/Proposal Writer, Medical Writer, Social Media Writer, and
   Technical Writer/Editor. Information products and technology skills
   varied substantially with job type. The job postings showed some
   differentiation in professional competencies across job categories, but
   they also revealed competencies that were common to all categories.
   Conclusion: Technical communication positions now encompass a wide range
   of audiences, content, contexts, and media. The jobs data illustrate the
   breadth of products and competencies that drive the field.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article describes a study conducted among technical
   communication managers. As one part of a special issue reporting on the
   entire study, this particular article focuses on the participants'
   responses to questions about education and training of technical
   communicators, including credentialing, skills and competencies, the gap
   between school and work, professional development, and the pattern of
   technical communication careers in terms of professional growth.
   Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we
   used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews.
   Results: Participants valued basic technical writing skills and
   traditional credentialing (such as college degrees in TPC) over
   technical degrees or certifications. Yet they also advised that academic
   programs push students to develop strategic thinking and other
   professional skills and confidence.
   Conclusion: Practitioners will need both basic skills and strategic
   skills to advance in their careers.},

Title = {Confidence-Increasing Elements in User Instructions: Seniors' Reactions
   to Verification Steps and Personal Stories},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {190-204},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Research shows that confidence-increasing elements in user
   instructions positively influence senior users' task performance and
   motivation. We added verification steps and personal stories to user
   instructions for a cell phone, to find out how seniors (between 60 and
   70 years) perceive these confidence-increasing motivational elements.
   Verification steps allow users to check if a procedure was carried out
   correctly. Personal stories describe how a fictitious user succeeded in
   completing a procedure.
   Method: The plus-minus method was used. Participants were asked to place
   pluses and minuses in cell phone user instructions to indicate their
   positive and negative reading experiences, and to explain their choices
   afterwards.
   Results: Verification steps are regarded as other, common parts of user
   instructions by seniors. Nineteen out of 20 participants appreciate
   verification steps, and they mainly encourage providing these because
   they are expected to decrease doubts, and increase user confidence and
   satisfaction. Personal stories tend to stand out compared to other,
   common parts of user instructions. Thirteen out of 20 participants
   appreciate personal stories, which use is mainly discouraged for
   redundancy reasons, and encouraged for their expected positive effects
   on user confidence and motivation.
   Conclusion: The use of verification steps and personal stories in user
   instructions seems acceptable to seniors. As a next step, it seems worth
   it to test for effects of these motivational elements on usability, user
   confidence and motivation.},

Title = {Amateur Hour: Credibility Testing for Small Business Web Sites},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {118-130},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Much has been written about the importance of Web site
   usability. However, a Web site that is usable in terms of navigation can
   still have credibility issues that reflect negatively on an
   organization. As a result, Website credibility assessments have gained
   popularity, but little research in that area has examined one of the
   most common forms of Web site communication-that is, small business Web
   sites that do not pose risk and do not offer e-commerce. This paper
   begins to address that gap by exploring the relationship between Web
   visitor expectations and their credibility judgments about a small
   business based on its Web site.
   Method: I conducted research based on principles of Prominence
   Interpretation Theory of Web credibility. This research included focus
   groups of likely consumers to explore the relationship between Web
   visitor expectations and judgments about the small business Web site and
   credibility judgments about the small business. Data from the focus
   groups was used to: (1) determine the factors that women use when
   setting expectations and making credibility judgments about a small
   business based on their Web experiences, and (2) identify if those
   factors vary generationally.
   Results: The results of the research revealed that likely consumers of
   the small business did not believe the Web experience projected a
   credible brand with which they would want to engage. In other words, a
   Web site that was intended to promote the products and the store was
   ironically hurting the business by turning away potential customers.
   Conclusion: I show how a six-step credibility test (based on
   Prominence-Interpretation Theory principles) can be used by
   communications consultants, Web site developers, and small-business
   owners. Such a test is an effective yet simple approach to gauging Web
   credibility judgments and making sustainable Web site changes in
   organizations with limited resources. The ease of this test combined
   with the time- and cost-effectiveness make it especially useful for
   small business Web sites, where expertise and resources may be limited.},

Title = {Signaling Context in Topic-Based Writing},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In topic-based writing delivered as web help or interactive PDF, readers
   are able to access topics non-linearly, reading only those topics they
   feel a need to read. Consequently, readers can easily lose a sense of a
   topic's broader context of related topics and concepts, which is
   knowledge presumed of a ``qualified reader.{''}
   Purpose: This paper investigates how relative ``that{''} and ``which{''}
   clauses are used to signal context in writing that is intended to be
   free of obligatory contextual connections to other topics in a
   documentation set.
   Method: This analysis relies on a computer-assisted, descriptive
   analysis of relative pronoun use in a corpus of published, topic-based
   documentation. The analysis focuses on ``that{''} and ``which,{''}
   typically used in English to refer to and add information (e.g., a
   context) about an antecedent noun.
   Results: Relative ``that{''} and ``which{''} clauses are shown to be
   used in a variety of ways in topic-based writing to signal associations
   between topics, making it easier for readers who need context to find
   it.
   Conclusions: The author offers implications for writing practice that
   include deliberate, strategic use of ``that{''} and ``which{''} and
   complementary documentation design that enables readers to locate
   contextual information signaled by those pronouns.},

Title = {Content and Authorship Patterns in Technical Communication Journals
   (1996-2017): A Quantitative Content Analysis},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {5-25},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: The maturity of technical communication merits a comprehensive,
   longitudinal analysis of the content published in its leading journals
   and the scholars who produce this research. Although reflexive research
   is common in the sciences and social sciences, few studies have analyzed
   the body of research in technical communication. Clarity on content and
   authorship patterns can help position the field for future relevance and
   sustainability.
   Method: We conducted a quantitative content analysis on 672 articles
   published in five leading technical communication journals from
   1996-2017. Articles were coded on nine content variables related to
   primary topic, primary audience, and authorship. We subsequently
   conducted a correspondence analysis on the variables to identify how
   specific content areas associated with the journals.
   Results: Content and authorship patterns were near identical to the
   patterns found in the field 30 years prior. The journals published
   content primarily focused on rhetoric, genre, pedagogy, and diversity.
   In contrast, field-defining topics-usability/UX, comprehension, design,
   and editing and style-appeared in the sample less than expected. A
   majority of research was single-authored and written by female first
   authors; further, a majority of the first authors had academic
   affiliations in the United States.
   Conclusion: Scholars must consider if these content and authorship
   patterns are the products of deliberate choices and, if so, if this is
   the field's inevitable trajectory for the next 30 years. We argue that
   certain topics are being overproduced while other topics that
   established the field are being underproduced and, in some cases, being
   assumed by other disciplines.},

Title = {The Rhetoric of Kamikaze Manuals},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {61-79},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: We rhetorically explore the phenomenon of kamikaze attacks from
   a technical communication and rhetorical perspective by analyzing two
   1945 Japanese military manuals, directed, respectively, to officers and
   pilots on how to organize and conduct suicide attacks against American
   warships.
   Method: We examine Japanese military ideology at a particular stage in
   the war to contextualize a rhetorical analysis of the two translated
   texts. We explore rhetorical dynamics implicit within the text, the
   texts as part of the instructional genre, and ethical concerns
   particular to the context of the texts and desired actions they
   describe.
   Results: We explore different complementary and dynamic rhetorical
   aspects of the texts, such as their approach to their respective
   audiences, the recurring subjects of remorse and questioning orders, the
   normalization of the suicidal act, the need for mental toughness in the
   pilots, the recurring use of the imperative mood, and the dehumanizing
   role of images. We conclude that certain pilot mortality affects the
   instructional form, the language reinforces the inevitability of the
   suicidal act, the images included dehumanize the act further, and the
   manuals seem created to address potential disciplinary issues.
   Conclusion: Through the genre of procedure, the two manuals help
   legitimize and normalize an invariably suicidal act. The two manuals are
   gripping case studies for discussion of ethical technical communication
   across cultures, in situational context, and as instructional genre,
   illustrating the power of written procedure to facilitate extreme acts.
   We suggest further studies in military technical communication,
   emphasizing cultural differences between different militaries.},

Title = {Defining Content Strategy as a Practice for Engagement},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-146},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article presents a methodology for using content strategy
   to promote behavior change in digital interventions. The concept of
   incorporating motivational theories for achieving health outcomes has
   been accepted as a valuable element across industries including public
   health, mental and physical healthcare, financial wellbeing, and
   education. The author will demonstrate how integrating principles from
   Self-Determination Theory-a leading theory of human motivation-with
   content strategy practices can successfully engage and motivate people
   across digital self-service platforms, focusing specifically on health
   care.
   Method: At Mad{*}Pow, the design team, content strategy team, and
   behavior change team have implemented content strategy practices in
   digital interventions via websites and applications. The creation of a
   content strategy guides the communication frequency, delivery style,
   information, and channels/touchpoints in order to best achieve the same
   goals that behavioral science does in face-to-face interventions. The
   intervention is then built, tested, and launched, after which the team
   tracks success metrics.
   Results: The Mad{*}Pow team has since measured results from clients and
   consumers, and can show how behavior change methodologies-as implemented
   using a strong content strategy-positively impact outcomes.
   Conclusion: Target audiences can be effectively engaged through content
   strategy in a manner beyond what is available via print, digital design,
   or other methods.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Current technical editing courses aren't meeting the needs of
   industry. This manuscript provides readers with a survey of recent
   editing-related job requirements, gives a brief assessment of popular
   technical editing textbooks, and describes two iterations of an editing
   course redesign in which the authors gave students a broader exposure to
   editing than text and markup.
   Method: The authors examined the job postings in conjunction with course
   descriptions, popular technical editing textbooks, and other media to
   gauge how well undergraduate classes were helping students gain
   necessary competencies for entering the workforce. Following, the
   authors redeveloped the curriculum for a 4000-level technical editing
   class. The curriculum reduced the focus on text editing and markup;
   instead, it framed the diversity of the profession to students through
   working with editing manuals/standards, MS Word and Adobe Acrobat, and
   audio, video, and websites. At semester's end, students were asked to
   provide feedback on course and content.
   Results: The revisions to the course disrupted student notions of
   pencils, paper, and grammar as the backbone of editing. Students were
   surprised by the new media focus but found it to be very useful. Most
   had little idea about the breadth of technical editing and enjoyed the
   exposure to multimodal editing. Most students, however, wanted more work
   with language basics.
   Conclusion: Editing jobs are morphing and students need practice in new
   media environments. Students are able to consider editing competencies
   as extending beyond text and traditional markup. Yet, most still feel
   uncomfortable with their own expertise in those areas. Programs should
   develop more than one editing class: a basic class for language, tools,
   and technologies, and an advanced class focusing on specific editing
   topics, such as video, audio, images, and Web.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {286-301},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article focuses on the integration of a specific client
   project, the production of an issue of an established ejournal, into the
   Technical Communication major at New Mexico Tech. Students experienced a
   ``workplace context{''} within their university classroom (replete with
   timeline challenges, requisite managerial decisions, and assignment
   delegation).
   Methods: Students' performance on required course documentation and
   ability to satisfactorily complete course goals were examined, and exit
   interviews were conducted and analyzed through the lens of theoretical
   frameworks offered by Cook (2002) and Blakeslee (2001) and correlated to
   previous research.
   Results: Students in the course described developed new literacies (per
   Cook) and participated in a process of gradual exposure, experiencing
   ``exposure, authenticity, transition, and response{''} as Blakeslee
   (2001) stresses, to professional, workplace communication genres.
   Conclusions: This client project can serve as one model for the kind of
   bridge for which Blakeslee et al. have called. A critical part of any
   bridge is its two ``destinations,{''} so our study points to both
   footings of such a structure-academic learning modules and workplace
   practices-both of which must be further explored by technical
   communication faculty and the technical communication professionals with
   whom they collaborate and with whom they confer about university program
   efficacy.},

Pages = {161-181},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article explores how businesses offering technical
   communication services used search engine optimization techniques to
   attract prospective clients to their business Web sites.
   Method: The study draws on a survey of 240 principals of these
   businesses, brief interviews with half of them, analyses of their sites,
   and tallies of inbound links to their sites.
   Results: The interviews and analyses reveal how businesses oriented
   their sites not only to a human audience of prospective clients but also
   to an audience of search engines. Businesses that reported search
   engines to be more helpful in directing traffic to their sites had sites
   that, in comparison with those of their less successful peers, featured
   longer home page titles and received more inbound links.
   Conclusion: Though search engine optimization techniques can increase
   Web site traffic, technical communication businesses varied widely in
   how extensively and expertly they used such techniques.},

Title = {The Contribution of Technical Communicators to the User-Centered Design
   Process of Personalized Systems},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {182-196},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article discusses how personalization will affect
   technical communication practitioners' everyday work, and indicates to
   researchers which knowledge gaps scientific research needs to fill.
   Method: After a description of how personalization exactly works, we
   demonstrate that the technique is very similar to the approach to
   personalization as applied in ancient rhetoric. Next, we describe how
   the history of the concept ``the audience,{''} and how it has been
   analyzed and approached, has led to the tactic of electronically
   tailoring communication to individuals. We propose the User-Centered
   Design approach as an approach that can help the designer get to know
   the individual user, thereby increasing the fit between personalized
   systems and users' needs, wishes, and contexts.
   Results: We discuss how the User-Centered Design approach needs to be
   adjusted to cope with the demands personalization places on the
   approach. Furthermore, we consider the technical communicator's role in
   this design process.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators need to devise and lead user studies
   that inform and evaluate each step of the personalization process.
   Researchers need to focus their efforts on studies that aid the design
   of personalized systems, like discerning in which situations
   personalization is of added value or not, and identifying the factors
   that influence the acceptance of personalization.},

Title = {Recursive Participatory Mentoring: A New Model for Mentoring Women in
   the Technical Communication Workplace},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {54-67},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Few organizations would question the importance of mentoring,
   yet mentoring is an under-researched aspect of technical communication.
   In fact, the vast amount of research across disciplines points to the
   need for new models for mentoring, particularly for women. This article
   offers a new mentoring model.
   Method: A comprehensive review of the literature with a workplace case
   study provides a foundation for a new mentoring model in technical
   communication, addressing the limitations of current models.
   Results: The literature review exposes weaknesses in current models for
   mentoring women. The recursive participatory mentoring (RPM) model
   developed in an academic setting shows potential for addressing these
   weaknesses, as shown through a workplace case study.
   Conclusion: Technical communication needs new and innovative mentoring
   models to address the needs of women in the workplace. The recursive
   participatory mentoring model we describe provides the flexibility to be
   implemented in diverse workplaces and professional organizations. The
   model has shown initial success in providing women access to sustainable
   mentoring through their careers.},

Title = {Beyond Accuracy: What Documentation Quality Means to Readers},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-29},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a preliminary, focused,
   clearly defined, and reader-oriented model for collecting meaningful and
   actionable feedback to improve documentation quality and increase reader
   satisfaction. This model is based on a narrow yet comprehensive set of
   15 distinct information quality dimensions (based on previous research
   by Wang and Strong, 1996) that cover all categories of information
   quality - Intrinsic, Contextual, Representational, and Accessibility
   (ICRA). Research was done to determine which information quality
   dimensions readers rated as most important per category (as they related
   to documentation), which were then used to create a clear,
   comprehensive, and empirically based definition of documentation quality
   from the readers' point of view. This definition of documentation
   quality is the heart of the model and provides a strong basis for
   measuring what readers want from the documentation we send them.
   Methods: Questionnaires were sent to readers, asking them to rate Wang
   \& Strong's information quality dimensions in terms of importance as
   they applied to documentation. Dimensions were sorted by information
   quality category, and the most important dimension per category (as
   determined by weighted average) was calculated.
   Results: According to readers, the following four information quality
   dimensions are the most important per ICRA category for documentation:
   Accurate, Relevant, Easy to Understand, and Accessible (AREA).
   Conclusions: We can use the AREA information quality dimensions to
   create a preliminary, focused, clearly defined, and reader-oriented
   model for collecting meaningful and actionable feedback that will
   improve documentation quality and increase reader satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To demonstrate the importance of standardized process modeling
   notation and its value to technical communicators involved with
   visualizing business or technical processes. To argue that a
   standardized process modeling notation can assist with bridging cultural
   communication gaps brought on by globalized workplaces.
   Method: A rhetorical analysis emphasizing how effectively technical
   communication visualizations address audience, purpose, and
   documentation conventions. Communication visualizations were modeled
   first using nonstandard and then standardized modeling techniques. The
   visualizations were generated as part of a qualitative study to
   represent the business and communication processes of a senior level
   employee from a software firm.
   Results: Nonstandard or proprietary data models and visualizations are
   not readily useful to diverse audiences, especially global audiences.
   Models should be developed with notation software that supports open
   standards.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators should become proficient with
   process modeling notation and understand the fundamentals of
   standardized notations such as Uniform Modeling Language (UML) and
   Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Academics teaching and
   researching technical communication should be wary of creating a divide
   between industry and the academy by perpetuating the use of non-standard
   models.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {186-211},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article presents a refined iterative development model
   that may be used to improve the processes related to information
   development. Specifically, the model is designed to facilitate rapid and
   incremental delivery and increased quality and efficiency.
   Method: The refined iterative development model is based on an analysis
   of models from across a range of industries. The analysis was designed
   to clearly define what a development model is, the basic phases it
   contains, and various common uses. The approach to this project was from
   the perspective of a practicing technical communication professional and
   project manager.
   Results: The analysis revealed that development models are visual,
   conceptual, representational, process-oriented, inventive, and both
   sequential and iterative. The basic phases common to development models
   are, generally speaking, Discovery, Planning, Implementation, Review,
   Refinement, and Release (or Deployment). Common uses include sharing
   knowledge, facilitating success, enhancing credibility, and
   demonstrating progress.
   Conclusion: The analysis and comparison allows for a deeper
   understanding of what a development model is and how a refined iterative
   development model can be used to improve processes related to
   information development.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Purpose: One of the major challenges for modern organizations is to
   create healthy and safe work environments, as evidenced by the number of
   occupational deaths (worldwide: four per minute), and an even higher
   number of injuries. This study explores different levels of motivation
   and ability, to identify which are most relevant for safety climate and
   safety performance. This study aims to pinpoint the areas information
   designers should focus on to most effectively contribute to healthy and
   safe work environments.
   Method: We designed a questionnaire for employees of a Dutch high-tech
   and high-risk warehouse, a workplace where safety regulations are
   important. The employees scored their attitudes regarding motivation,
   ability, safety climate, and safety performance.
   Results: The results confirmed the expected relationship between safety
   climate and safety performance. Of the explored sublevels of motivation
   and ability, personal motivation and external ability proved most
   relevant for creating a healthy safety climate and healthy safety
   performance.
   Conclusion: In the design of safety instructions, focusing on personal
   motivation and external ability seems a promising strategy for
   contributing to healthy and safe work environments, especially in
   high-risk environments.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To develop a theoretical model that layers community structure
   on top of employee social media engagement to improve social capital.
   This improved social capital leads to tacit knowledge sharing.
   Method: The proposed theoretical model is grounded in previously
   published research on organizational social capital and communities of
   practice, relevant literature, and survey research. The authors examine
   aspects of their previous research in social media and communities to
   build a theoretical model.
   Results: The theoretical model shows the congruent outcomes that occur
   when using social media to establish communities of practice to address
   the problem of sharing tacit knowledge within an organization.
   Conclusions: Communities of practice can form an important bridge
   between social media technology and people within an organization.
   Technical communicators can layer communities of practice on the top of
   social media for an effective strategy to develop increased social
   capital to support innovation, communication, and body of knowledge
   efforts.},

Title = {Not That Button but the Other: Misunderstanding and Non-understanding in
   Helpdesk Encounters Involving Nonnative English Speakers},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {179-194},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: The internationalization of ``technical help over the phone{''}
   is tied to the increasing usage of a lingua franca facilitating the
   interaction between a call center agent and a caller who are both
   linguistically different. Researchers have noted that interactions
   between two parties who are nonnative users of the language employed for
   the encounter are peppered with understanding problems. This study looks
   into the causes of understanding problems in helpdesk encounters between
   nonnative speakers of English and the techniques those interacting
   parties used to resolve or prevent flaws in the conversation.
   Method: Conversation analysis was used to analyze 25 recorded phone
   calls, amounting to 750 minutes of data, made in a commercial call
   center and in the helpdesk of an international academic institute in
   Enschede, the Netherlands.
   Results: Analysis of the phone calls reveals that causes of
   understanding problems between an agent and a caller who are nonnative
   users of English go beyond asymmetries in their proficiency with the
   language. Factors such as incomplete information or erroneous inference
   from the utterance of the partner in the interaction are important
   triggers for the occurrence of understanding problems. Consequently,
   call center agents and callers use varied repair and preventative
   techniques to ensure that understanding problems will not impede the
   attainment of the primary goal of the encounter-to resolve the
   product-related problem of the caller.
   Conclusion: While understanding problems are inevitable in helpdesk
   encounters, especially those that involved nonnative users of the
   language employed for the interaction, such problems are hardly
   attributable to the linguistic differences characterizing interacting

Pages = {11-25},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article chronicles the STC Technical Communication Body of
   Knowledge process from 2007 to 2009 and provides key elements of a
   landmark project to develop a body of disciplinary knowledge.
   Method: The author, who is a member of the Body of Knowledge Task Force,
   documents the chronology of the project through firsthand accounts. A
   brief review of literature helps to place this initiative within the
   context of technical communication professionalization and identifies
   its uniqueness from previous efforts.
   Results: The project demonstrates a productive partnership between
   practitioners and academics. It promises to help technical communicators
   assess their own level of knowledge and skills, provide easily
   accessible information for those wanting to hire technical communicators
   or enter the profession, and define the profession as a specialized set
   of skills, abilities, and knowledge.
   Conclusion: This project laid the groundwork for a body of knowledge
   that has the potential to establish technical communication as a true
   profession.},

   The concept of information is examined from the perspectives of
   mathematics, engineering, biology, and human behavior. Characteristics
   of information common to all information systems are brought forward to
   a key understanding-that information is inextricably linked with
   behavior. It follows that the first step in designing an information
   product is to state its purpose in terms of a desired behavioral
   outcome. Measuring behavior then becomes the most significant measure of

Abstract = {New business proposals to the U.S. Department of Defense vary so much in
   their preparation requirements that it has never been easy to estimate
   the cost to prepare them. Worse, new proposal managers lack the
   experience to anticipate the work required to prepare a winning
   proposal. In many companies, marketing and technical communication
   organizations find it exceptionally difficult to estimate and acquire
   the realistic budgets needed to win.
   For the past 3 years, we have closely examined significant proposal
   efforts and discovered the six pillars of our department's proposal
   preparation costs. We have also derived a formula that characterizes
   proposal preparation costs in our environment. Our Cost Projection
   Factor estimate can be calculated in a minute and has demonstrated
   accuracy within 5 percent. Our purpose in preparing this article is not
   to reveal our proprietary proposal costs, but to demonstrate that a
   quick, accurate cost model can be developed for proposal publishing.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {43-54},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this article, the content strategy for technical content
   marketing (TCM) is examined for a start-up tech company, Terra Solar,
   commercializing a ``do-ityourself{''} (DIY) home solar power kit that
   makes clean energy more affordable and accessible to a wider range of
   consumers. Notably, this article illustrates the role of technical
   communication in technical content marketing using the funnel-bucket
   model, a framework for implementing content strategy for new products,
   to inform the communication goals of an entrepreneurial technology
   company and provides a framework for implementing content marketing
   publication strategy for new technical products. Method: This case study
   integrates theory, research, and industry practices of content strategy,
   technical content marketing, advertising, digital marketing, and
   technical communication. Results: This article situates strategic
   marketing plans with the theory of content strategy and includes a
   review of the latest research in content marketing to provide readers
   with a research-based guide for planning the commercialization strategy
   for technology products. Conclusion: This case study describes the use
   of the funnel-bucket model as a framework for planning TCM genres to
   provide a coordinated set of informative and persuasive product-related
   information through multiple media platforms to reach target technical

Abstract = {Purpose: This study re-examines contemporary localization theory to
   understand the shortcomings of the theory using the case of a
   state-sponsored postcolonial technology localization project. I call for
   centering the analysis of the power reticulations in context-specific
   technology localization.Method: I engaged in extensive review of
   existing research on the subject and conducted ethnographic and digital
   surveys with users and non-users of the technology I studied. This
   method provided nuanced perspectives on technology localization for a
   grounded user experience analysis.Results: Against current theoretical
   assumptions that support localization in user contexts as the solution
   to the chasm between developer culture and user culture, I argue that
   the reticular nature of power and developers' neglect of users'
   geo-epistemology also create a chasm within localization at users'
   sites.Conclusion: We need to examine the complex work of power in user
   contexts as part of a holistic theory on technology localization in user
   contexts. Thus, current assumptions must be revised. This revision must
   insist on the primary role of users' worldings in localization. The
   context of the postcolony provides a privileged insight into theorizing
   technology localization and must not be seen only as a ``kingdom of
   ethnography{''} (Mbembe, 2021, p. 14).},

Title = {Data Handling Process in Extended Reality (XR) When Delivering Technical
   Instructions},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {75-96},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Extended reality (XR) is a promising new medium that creates
   environments combining real and virtual elements or offers a completely
   virtual environment for people to experience. In the field of technical
   communication, XR offers a plethora of possibilities, such as augmenting
   critical instructions in a work environment.On the downside, XR brings
   about challenges. For example, issues of privacy and security require
   more attention due to the risks involved with XR devices continuously
   collecting data from the users and their surroundings. More knowledge
   concerning the use of XR as a medium to deliver technical instructions
   is required. In this article, I address this need by explaining how XR
   handles data.Methods: To find out how XR handles data, I used relevant
   previous research (33 papers and four books) as data for thematic
   analysis. I coded data systematically according to how XR has been used
   before and the phases that can be seen in the process of data handling
   in XR when it is used as a medium for technical instructions.Results:
   The data handled in XR can be divided into instructional data, such as
   assembly instructions, and collected data that XR equipment collects
   while someone is using it. Data handling in XR can be seen as a process.
   Based on the thematic analysis, I found six different phases of data
   handling: collection, processing, storage, transfer, combining, and
   presentation.Conclusion: The phases of data handling in XR illustrate in
   general what happens to the data in XR and what kind of data the
   equipment collects. My findings add to our understanding of XR as a
   medium to deliver technical instructions. They also offer a usable
   framework for mapping the differences between XR and other media as a
   way to deliver technical instructions.},

Title = {Cultural Differences and the Structure of User Instructions: Effects of
   Chinese and Western Structuring Principles on Chinese and Western Users},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Although various researchers have paid attention to differences
   in the way Chinese and Western documents are structured, only few have
   investigated how Chinese and Western users differ in their way of using
   instructions. This study experimentally investigates the effects Chinese
   and Western manual structures have on Chinese and Western users, in
   terms of task performance, user satisfaction, and information selection.
   Method: A 3x2 randomized experiment (N = 127) was conducted, with
   participants' cultural background (Chinese living in China, Chinese
   living in the Netherlands, and Westerners) and manual structure (Chinese
   versus Western) as independent variables and task performance, user
   satisfaction, and information selection as dependent variables.
   Supported by a manual, participants performed tasks with Excel and
   afterwards filled out a satisfaction questionnaire. To investigate
   information selection, eye-tracking data were collected.
   Results: Regarding task performance and user satisfaction, no
   significant main and interaction effects were found. Regarding
   information selection, our research confirmed some of the hypothesized
   differences between Chinese and Western users: Chinese users pay less
   attention to structuring elements (table of contents and headings) and
   more attention to visuals.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that cultural adaptations of the
   structure of manuals do not really matter: Chinese and Western users
   perform equally well and have similar satisfaction scores with Western
   and Chinese manual structures. Paradoxically, the differences found in
   users' information selection behaviors provided some support for the
   differences in document design practices. However, users of both
   cultures appear to be sufficiently flexible in using instructions that
   are not culturally adapted.},

Title = {Communication Strategies for Diagnosing Technical Problems at a Help
   Desk},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {375-395},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study intended to help technical support providers
   understand different communication strategies for diagnosing users'
   technical problems and how users may communicate those problems. Also,
   the study intended to help future researchers to better understand
   users' experience in seeking technical help.
   Method: To contribute to this research area, I examined 18 help desk
   visits between 11 users and 6 technical support providers in an
   in-person help desk at a four-year university in the Midwest United
   States. I analyzed the communication for stages of the conversation in
   which the component devoted to diagnosing technical problems existed,
   closely analyzed the dialogue of both speakers during this stage, and
   explored associations between the communication strategies they used and
   the user satisfaction based on a customer-support satisfaction survey.
   Results: The statistical tests suggested that more dialogue about the
   users' technical problem seems to associate with user satisfaction. The
   tests did not reveal a strong association between specific communication
   strategies and user satisfaction. The analysis of the visits showed how
   users shared their experiences through narratives and minimal responses,
   and how technical support providers used inquiries to understand user
   needs and experiences, providing a framework for understanding what the
   strategies look like.
   Conclusions: This research provides a reliable way of identifying and
   categorizing the ways two speakers communicate to diagnose a technical
   problem, which provides a framework for new technical support providers
   to communicate during this part of the discussion.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {66},

Pages = {93-104},

Abstract = {Purpose: As the field of Technical Communication adapts to changing
   conditions, new ways of describing the field are vital. This article
   discusses important characteristics of hypertext theory, developed over
   the last 70+ years, as a theoretical foundation that informs and defines
   the core competencies and practices of the field of technical
   communication.
   Method: This article initially reviews the significant literature on
   hypertext theory as well as recent selections, which help situate or
   define technical communication in the 21st century. From this
   literature, we developed a framework to examine correlations between
   characteristics of hypertext theory and compared those to skills,
   processes, and products in technical communication.
   Results: Hypertext is a foundational theory which informs the processes
   and practices of contemporary technical communication, and in
   particular, core competencies in developing content, design, structure,
   and in the processes of information development and user experience
   design. Given technological evolutions, technical communicators continue
   to work with content informed by hypertextual theories and practices, to
   create multi-pathed, user-driven, dynamic experiences.
   Conclusions: Characteristics of hypertext theory have become essential
   parts of the core competencies required in the daily work of technical
   communicators. Furthermore, they can be used to describe our daily work
   as well as to help us frame professional development, certification
   programs, and identify as a field.},

Title = {Identifying Risk Communication Deficiencies: Merging Distributed
   Usability, Integrated Scope, and Ethics of Care},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-264},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Risk communication research examines how people communicate
   risk to prevent accidents and fatalities. Past studies have analyzed
   risk communication effectiveness from one of two frameworks: a textual
   approach (meaning is in the text) or a socio-cultural approach (meaning
   is external to the text). Some studies have merged textual and
   sociocultural approaches, yet none to date have merged both approaches
   with an analysis of usability and ethics, specifically. A more useful
   analysis would combine such approaches to examine the broader system
   that makes up risk communication, using distributed usability and what
   Spinuzzi (2003) called ``integrated scope{''} with a lens on ethics.
   Method: I examine existing frameworks used to analyze risk communication
   and offer a merged framework emphasizing distributed usability,
   integrated scope, and an ethics of care philosophy for identifying
   communication deficiences. I use archival research to retrace a
   historical case of how artifacts were used in a communication system at
   an industrial setting when a fatal explosion occurred.
   Results: I use this historical case analysis to show that a merged
   framework with distributed usability, integrated scope, and an ethics of
   care philosophy provides a more comprehensive and concrete approach for
   identifying risk communication deficiencies and preventing injuries and
   fatalities.
   Conclusion: Examining complex work systems through this new merged
   framework expands our understanding of the interplay between
   textual-level components of our information (placement, accuracy, and
   details) and the social/cultural/political environments that define how
   workers act. Practitioners and researchers can apply this new merged
   framework to analyze past and current risk communication systems to
   identify usability deficiencies and prevent accidents.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article reports communication strategies used by a
   Vietnamese nonprofit organization to cultivate community engagement. One
   purpose is to convey a particular, non Western perspective which can be
   considered alongside existing literature to highlight similarities and
   differences in different contexts.
   Method: A qualitative field study investigating the question, ``What are
   some strategies and keys to communication that facilitate community
   engagement and stakeholder participation, especially related to issues
   of Agent Orange in Vietnamese contexts?{''} We interviewed 38
   participants across eleven provinces in north and central Vietnam.
   Results: The organization studied cultivates community engagement by:
   Conveying information through activities and experiences (experiencing
   information), powerful images (seeing information), and numbers
   (quantifying information)
   Using that information to promote community engagement by reducing
   stigma and drawing upon a sense of responsibility
   Conclusion: The organization's community engagement strategies are both
   similar to and different from those conveyed in existing research on
   community engagement practice. The purpose of community engagement
   prioritizes unity, not dissent-a major difference. But the organization
   is highly attuned to preserving human dignity a significant similarity.
   The organization intentionally hooks into cultural values to motivate
   community engagement using rhetorical strategies appropriate to the
   local context-a similar strategy-but those rhetorical strategies are
   rooted in different frameworks, requiring different sensibilities and
   tools than those typically used in Western contexts.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This article reports on a study of professional public

   Impact Statement to reveal the practices used in making public
   engagement an inclusive and dialogic (rather than exclusive and one-way)
   process.
   Methods: This qualitative study was conducted over two years and
   included formal and informal interviews, observations of workplace and
   public projects, and the collection of project documents.
   Results: My findings suggest that technical communicators who hope to
   implement public engagement function across three different roles within
   the dialogic public engagement process: participant, facilitator, and
   designer.
   Conclusions: The roles of participant, facilitator, and designer expand
   the potential of technical communicators and require an attention to
   understudied skills in the field of technical communication, including
   listening and interrogating boundaries.},

   Collaborative Approach},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {97-112},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: The authors, one a researcher and one an international
   community strategy practitioner, illustrate community strategy work as a
   multi-faceted localization practice that intersects with user experience
   design and user localization. We argue that localized community strategy
   is crucial not only to practice that aims for inclusivity and social
   justice but also to research and theory building that aims for
   inclusivity and social justice.
   Method: We model a dialogic, localized knowledge-making process that
   operates at the level of collaborative research between a theorist and a
   practitioner and at the level of international practice. The authors
   collaboratively analyzed the experiences of the practitioner, as well as
   our own collaboration process, and coded them for key dimensions, which
   can guide and be further developed both in practice and in research.
   Results: The authors identify and discuss four key dimensions of a
   community strategist's localization practices-localizing communities,
   localizing goals, localizing communication, and localizing inclusion-and
   illustrate them both in our own collaborative practice of analysis and
   in the practice of international community strategy.
   Conclusion: The definitions of user, community, and diversity themselves
   must be continually localized in our work to engage across cultures and
   across theory and practice. We call for further collaboration and
   research at the intersections of international community strategy work
   with technical communication and global user experience, particularly
   the role of localizing diversity and inclusion.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {223-237},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Successful grant writers: assess what a proposed project has to
   offer, understand what a grant-making agency wants, and communicate a
   clear match between the two. The issue is how to develop an
   understanding of what grant-making agencies want and effectively
   communicate with target audiences.
   Method: Applying modality analysis, based on pedagogical theories
   focused on learning styles, to publications from a funding source
   involves identifying words that are associated with visual, auditory, or
   kinesthetic orientations. Matching the identified communication
   style/modality of the funding source can enhance communication and
   funding success.
   Results: Experience with grant proposals that use rhetorical approaches
   that are based on modality analysis of agency publications can attain
   more success than other submissions.
   Conclusion: A grant writer can base his/her selection of rhetorical
   approaches on modality analysis, which seems to be a viable way to make
   one's grant proposal text connect with the values, priorities, and
   communication preferences of a funding source, and this connection
   enhances chances for success.},

   standard, empirical research on them is still surprisingly rare: Little
   knowledge exists about general attitudes toward presentation software or
   users' functional demands other than editing texts and images.
   Therefore, we focus in our explorative study on users' handling and
   evaluation of such software, including a comparison between educational
   and business users.
   Method: A total of 1014 participants (51\% female, 49\% male) took part
   in a web-based study. Among them were 444 students and 570 employees
   from different fields. The online questionnaire consisted of 67
   questions in three parts and was based on the current literature and
   ratings of five experts.
   Results: Our results show a strong preference for using Microsoft
   PowerPoint, which led to rather satisfied users. Computer-based
   presentations are mainly used in educational settings, talks, and
   meetings. Differences between students and employees were identified,
   with the latter showing a broader use. Furthermore, independent of
   occupation, participants stressed the importance of usability aspects
   such as ease of use, compatibility, or loading speed; however, they
   equally desired more creativity in computer-based presentations and
   better speakers.
   Conclusions: The process of slide generation seems to be patchwork, and
   a large amount of time is spent on design and animation; thus we
   recommend measures to reduce the time spent on matters of visual style.
   In addition, current presentation software still suffers from several
   usability issues. Generally, the central function of the speaker and the
   supporting role of the presentation software are to be stressed.},

Title = {QuikScan: Formatting Documents for Better Comprehension and Navigation},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-209},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Design: QuikScan is an innovative format that makes print and online
   documents more usable. QuikScan employs within-document summaries
   formatted as numbered list items. These numbers correspond to numbers
   placed in the body of the document where the summarized ideas are
   discussed in full. QuikScan enables readers to (1) read summaries
   instead of the detailed content, (2) use the summaries as previews, (3)
   navigate quickly to the place where a summarized idea is fully discussed
   in the body of the document, and (4) direct other individuals to
   locations in the document. QuikScan is nonproprietary; anyone is free to
   use it and adapt it to their needs.
   Requirements: QuikScanning requires the skills of a talented editor and
   takes practice to master. QuikScanners must choose among four kinds of
   summaries and three numbering systems, depending on the document's
   heading structure and other factors. Document elements such as graphics
   require special techniques. The list items that make up QuikScan
   summaries must be skillfully written, and target numbers must be placed
   with care.
   Results: Empirical studies have demonstrated that QuikScan improves
   comprehension and the ability to navigate quickly through a document. In
   addition, QuikScan is regarded positively by readers. A pilot study
   suggests the value of QuikScan for blind readers.
   Drawbacks and limitations: QuikScan requires extra work, makes documents
   longer, and increases both visual complexity and the number of short
   pages. It is not suitable for documents that do not much benefit from
   summarization or for documents with free-form layouts.},

Title = {Increasing Inclusion in Technical Communication Academic Programs},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical communication (TC) academic programs are responsible
   for training future technical communication practitioners. Increasing
   diversity in the field starts with increasing diversity in academic
   programs and helping students from diverse backgrounds to graduate.
   Previous research has shown a lack of diversity in technical
   communication academic programs and a lack of inclusive practices in
   higher education in general. This study seeks to show how technical
   communication program administrators can increase support for students
   from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds through better
   inclusion.Method: I conducted qualitative interviews with undergraduate
   students, graduate students, and pre-tenured faculty members regarding
   their experiences in technical communication academic programs.
   Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for emerging
   themes.Results: Interview participants identified several areas where TC
   academic programs can increase inclusion, including focusing on
   inclusion rather than simply increasing diversity, problems with
   microaggressions, lack of representation, and the complications brought
   about by intersectionality.Conclusion: TC academic programs, like higher
   education in general, are interested in increasing diversity. However,
   rather than focusing on simply increasing the number of students from
   diverse backgrounds, TC programs should focus on increasing program
   inclusiveness. This includes actively including diverse voices in
   program decision making and being willing to make changes based on the
   thoughts, ideas, and opinions of traditionally marginalized people.
   These recommendations can also be used by practitioners to begin
   increasing inclusion in the workplace.},

Title = {Creating a Model for Developing and Evaluating Technical Instructions
   that use Extended Reality},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {24-39},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Extended reality (XR) is an umbrella term for the many ways
   that we can now design 3D, interactive, and real-time environments as in
   combining virtual and real elements, and experience immersion in a
   completely virtual reality (VR). The use of XR is increasing in
   popularity across a range of industries. Although researchers are
   becoming increasingly interested in the benefits and challenges of using
   XR to convey technical instructions, more comprehensive research is
   required. I aim to address this need in the present article by
   introducing an affordance model of Technical Instructions in Extended
   Reality, the TIER model.
   Two earlier categorizations, the affordances of technical instructions,
   and the phases of data handling in XR, formed the point of departure for
   this article. The analysis utilized a four-category model of affordances
   by Rantakokko and Nuopponen (2019) that comprised: accessing, finding,
   understanding, and relying on. Data handling in XR drew on a phase-based
   model by Rantakokko (2022) featuring: collection, processing, storage,
   transfer, combining, and presentation.
   Methods: The two sets of categorizations were combined into a holistic
   model with an iterative process in order to offer a tool for analyzing
   and describing the possibilities and challenges that XR brings to
   designing technical instructions. The iterative process was conducted by
   adding examples from existing research into matrix tables to understand
   how the affordances of technical instructions and the phases of data
   handling in XR are connected.
   Results: The TIER model is introduced with examples to illustrate how it
   can be used to view every phase of XR data handling in terms of the
   affordances of technical instructions based on the laws, regulations,
   principles of good guidance, and the design process.
   Conclusion: The TIER model can be used as a tool for an organized,
   step-by-step design process as well as testing XR-based technical
   instructions to ensure that the features of XR support the intended
   affordances of technical instructions.},

   software. In 2013, van der Meij and van der Meij proposed eight
   guidelines for the design of instructional videos for software training.
   Since then, production techniques and video features evolved, and new
   insights about characteristics of effective video instructions
   emerged.Methods: Based on recent study outcomes and our reflections on
   instructional video designs, the original set of eight guidelines was
   restructured, updated, and extended.Results: A new framework with 11
   guidelines was constructed. For these guidelines the article provides
   scientifically-based advice for the design of instructional videos for
   software training.Conclusion: The new framework and the illustrations of
   how the guidelines were applied in videos should provide useful insights
   for further practice and research on instructional video design.},

Title = {Using Schema for Analyzing Audiences: Complexity and Simplicity Balance},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This paper builds on a primary study (Sentell, 2016) that
   demonstrated how information can be presented more memorably through
   engaging an audience's collective (self)schema. It analyzes real-world
   examples of these strategies and theorizes implications for audience
   analysis.
   Method: An Uncle Sam poster promoting handwashing in a VA hospital and
   JFK's ``man on the moon{''} speech are analyzed as notable examples of
   memorable communication. Each example illustrates (self)schema's
   influence on attention and recall as well as the strategies of engaging
   (self)schema: tapping the familiar, bridging to the unfamiliar,
   conveying practical value, and arousing emotions. I discuss how (self)
   schema can be used as a framework for analyzing audiences and developing
   personas.
   Results: Using (self)schema as a framework for audience analysis is an
   intuitive, holistic alternative to more time- and resource-intensive
   methods. It can balance the competing needs for complex,
   multidimensional representations of audience and limited, simple
   distillations of those representations that can be useful during
   composing. Analyzing an audience's (self)schema can clearly organize a
   variety of dimensions and generate insights into likely emotional
   predispositions. Understanding the audience's (self) schema facilitates
   using familiarity, unfamiliarity, practical value, and emotions to
   enhance information's memorableness.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators can use the concept of (self)schema
   to analyze audiences, craft personas, and engage the audience's
   (self)schema to make information more memorable, persuasive, and
   effective.},

Title = {Fertile Grounds: What Interviews of Working Professionals Can Tell Us
   about Perceptions of Technical Communication and the Viability of
   Technical Communication as a Field},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-62},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this paper, I discuss contemporary perspectives on the
   professionalization and legitimacy of technical and professional
   communication (TPC) as a field and describe results of an
   interview-based pilot study based in modified grounded theory. The
   purpose is to study perceptions of TPC and communication practice,
   particularly as those perceptions relate to professionalization and
   legitimacy of TPC as a field.
   Method: The method of data collection is the semi-structured interview.
   In the study, I interviewed 14 participants in diverse industries about
   formal communications produced by their organizations, their perceptions
   of technical communication practice, and the possibility that their
   organizations will hire a technical communicator in the future. I then
   used a modified grounded theory approach to data analysis: one cycle of
   structural coding, a second cycle of pattern coding.
   Results: Analysis of data suggests that, despite the importance of
   communication in organizations, perceptions of TPC as a field are
   variable and, though participants demonstrate a basic understanding of
   TPC practice, their perceptions are often incomplete, not reflecting the
   range of capabilities that TPC professionals often possess.
   Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that challenges to the
   professionalization and legitimacy of TPC continue to exist. Addressing
   these challenges will require continuing alignment of academic and
   practical perspectives on the field, as well as continued work to
   promote TPC's value in a range of workplace settings.},

Title = {Articulating Value Amid Persistent Misconceptions about Technical and
   Professional Communication in the Workplace},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {210-222},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: The current conditions of technical and professional
   communication (TPC) practice reveal that the field has work left to
   accomplish in terms of proving value across disciplines. This article
   suggests that articulating the value of TPC is an ongoing process,
   particularly for practitioners, who have found ways to combat
   stereotypes.
   Method: Findings are based on 39 qualitative, semistructured interviews
   with female practitioners of TPC. Participants were solicited across the
   United States and varied in age, class, industry, organization,
   ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, and
   marital/family status. This article uses feminist research
   methodologies, with data from semistructured interviews analyzed through
   feminist content analysis.
   Results: The data suggests that TPC is still considered to be expendable
   in workplaces. Participants highlighted the misconceptions and
   mischaracterizations of their work, including the myths that TPC work is
   cosmetic, secretarial, unarticulated, unnecessary, invisible, and
   unquantifiable. However, practitioners are moving forward despite these
   misconceptions. They face a host of pressures, but these conflicts are
   opportunities to prove value and change misconceptions.
   Conclusion: Devaluation continues to permeate the profession, but
   practitioners have become skilled at combatting it. They know that
   educating others on the value of TPC is an ongoing project, highlighting
   the ability of practitioners to be an integral part of an expanding
   knowledge economy, all-edge adhocracies, and unique and networked
   organizations. Practitioners and scholars must continue to challenge and
   change stereotypes about TPC.},

Title = {The Re-Emergence of Emotional Appeals in Interactive Data Visualization},

Abstract = {Purpose: I argue that emotional appeals, prevalent in charts and graphs
   during the later nineteenth century but largely dormant since then, have
   rapidly re-emerged in contemporary data visualization. Changing the
   relationship between designer and user, this new form of data design has
   intensified the affective impact of data displays by eliciting emotions
   ranging from excitement and empathy to anxiety and fear.
   Methods: This article draws on historical and contemporary sources to
   build its case. It gives an overview of emotional appeals in the
   rhetorical tradition, from Aristotle to modern theorists like George
   Campbell, who emphasized sensory responses through personalization and
   proximity. The article provides an historical overview of pathos appeals
   in data design during the later nineteenth century and the shift to
   modernist minimalism in the twentieth century. Contemporary examples
   from companies, nonprofits, government agencies, and individual
   designers illustrate how data visualization arouses emotion.
   Results: Emotional appeals during the nineteenth century focused
   primarily on color and design novelty, which, by appealing largely to
   the senses, fostered emotional responses such as excitement and
   curiosity. Contemporary data visualization makes similar emotional
   appeals through the use of color, novelty, and multimodal features;
   however, digital technology also allows designers to appeal to the
   emotions by personalizing displays through interactivity, spatial and
   temporal proximity, and aesthetic and expressive elements.
   Conclusion: Pathos (emotional) appeals have become an integral part of
   contemporary data visualization, largely because of the multimodal and
   interactive affordances of digital technology. Designers who understand
   this dimension of data design can deploy technology to make their
   displays more engaging, humane, and usable.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The chronicle of a global approach to information communication
   design (ICD) does not always translate when applied to cultures in
   countries around the world. In this study, I wanted to know if the
   designers of Souq.com relied solely on the universal principles of ICD
   to build a uniquely Arabized and successful site. Equally, I wanted to
   discover what other dimensions are in play when it comes to designing
   content for target users.
   Method: I reviewed the literature and developed a framework based on key
   indicators of ICD. I then analyzed the layout and Web content of
   Souq.com by examining interface and content, focusing on the homepage.
   Results: The principles of ICD, while foundational, require additional
   knowledge in order to meet the needs of local users and to build a sense
   of ownership of those principles. The process of designing for local
   users can benefit from insider knowledge and singular interpretation of
   a people's culture, language, and traditions.
   Conclusion: ICD is invaluable for the basic framework it offers.
   However, its principles are in themselves insufficient when it comes to
   designing not globally but locally.},

Volume = {61},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Video tutorials for software training are rapidly becoming
   popular. A set of dedicated guidelines for the construction of such
   tutorials was recently advanced in Technical Communication (Van der Meij
   \& Van der Meij, 2013). The present study set out to assess the
   cognitive and motivational effects of a video tutorial based on these
   guidelines.
   Method: Participants were 65 students (mean age 12.0 years) from
   elementary school. The procedure was as follows. First, students
   completed a pre-test. Next, they viewed videos and completed practice
   tasks. Finally, students completed a post-test and retention-test.
   Results: The pre-test revealed low scores on task relevance, and low
   initial task performance. During training, students reported positive
   mood states, high flow, and significantly higher task relevance than in
   pre-testing. Task performance rose significantly during training, and
   was also substantially higher on the post-test and retention-test than
   in pre-testing. Only cognitive factors significantly predicted task
   performance.
   Conclusion: The effectiveness of the video tutorial attests to the
   quality of the design guidelines on which it was based. The critical
   contribution of specific guidelines are a potential area for further
   research.},

Title = {Using Sorting Data to Evaluate Text Structure: An Evidence-based
   Proposal for Restructuring Patient Information Leaflets},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {197-216},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This paper assesses the text structure imposed on patient
   information leaflets in the European Union (EU). It proposes an
   alternative structure based on reader-oriented research.
   Method: Two card-sorting studies were used to identify reader
   expectations. In a closed card-sorting study, participants were provided
   with scenario questions on medication use and were asked under which of
   the template headings they expected to find information on each
   question. In an open sorting task, the schemata of patient information
   leaflet readers were explored. In this study, participants sorted a
   large set of sentences that can be found in actual patient information
   leaflets.
   Results: The closed card-sorting study reveals that users provided with
   the EU template structure do not always look at the correct section when
   searching information about patient situations. The results of the open
   card-sorting study indicate that readers prefer the following structure:
   goal of the medicine - directions for use - potential problems -
   packaging and storage.
   Conclusion: Card-sorting data help to evaluate and design text
   structures for genres such as patient information leaflets. The European
   template does not match users' expectations concerning the leaflet's
   structure. There is a mismatch between the wording of headings and
   reader interpretations. A second mismatch has to do with classifying and
   grouping information. Patient information presented in the alternative
   format may be expected to improve reading performance.},

Title = {Legal and Regulatory Issues for Technical Communicators Conducting
   Global Internet Research},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {282-299},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article discusses the ethical and regulatory issues that
   technical communicators need to consider when conducting Internet
   research.
   Method: We open by considering how technical communicators live, work,
   and do research in global contexts where distributed networks for the
   design, development, and distribution of documents, interfaces, and
   technologies span cultural and geographic borders. By drawing on
   published case work and interviews with technical communicators who work
   in global contexts, we examine the key legal and ethical issues
   technical communicators face when they are conducting Internet research.
   We propose heuristics for technical communicators to use when addressing
   these issues.
   Results: Key legal and regulatory issues that technical communicators
   face when conducting Internet research include the diversity of legal
   regimes, the variability of privacy laws and cultural differences, the
   impact of government surveillance on research risks, and the complexity
   of intellectual property in a global world.
   Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be aware of the potential
   legal and regulatory challenges they may encounter when conducting
   Internet research that spans cultural and geographic borders. By
   consulting precedent cases, seeking advice from diverse audiences (e.g.,
   focal participants, corporate legal), and remaining flexible in research
   design, technical communicators can successfully meet these challenges.},

Title = {Convergent Practices in Social Media Videos: Examining Genre Conventions
   in Business-to-Consumer Content},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {27-42},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical communication (tech comm) and marketing communication
   (marcomm) are converging in business-to-consumer (B2C) contexts.
   Convergent videos integrate practices from both genres to address
   ever-changing digital audiences. In this paper, we review available
   literature and analyze tech comm and marcomm social media videos to
   demonstrate traditional genre conventions. We then analyze a select
   couple of convergent social media videos to delineate genre conventions
   across genres. We end by considering four unique convergent strategies
   that these videos used in combining elements of the tech comm and
   marcomm genres. Methods: We selected several social media videos
   produced by large home improvement brands to analyze the generic
   practices they employ in relation to accepted best practices in the
   literature from scholars in tech comm and marcomm. We then analyze
   videos that fit neither genre in light of recent publications by Adobe
   discussing genre convergence and note several distinct genre practices
   that can be ascribed to convergent videos. Results: We find that
   convergent characteristics are distinct from tech comm and marcomm. The
   brands employ convergent practices in some social media videos that
   blend genre conventions from tech comm and marcomm video production.
   Specifically, we identify four ways that these genres converge: using
   technical tasks as marketing opportunities, balancing corporate branding
   with mundane user ethos, layering content pathways across the interface,
   and capturing attention with relevance. Conclusion: Convergence
   represents a new genre in that it purposefully attempts to engage users
   across the product lifecycle in single videos. This approach is a
   departure from traditional marcomm and tech comm video production.
   Though limited in scope, this analysis provides examples of how
   convergent videos attempt to achieve this goal. We end by noting our
   limitations and offering suggestions for future research.},

Title = {When Traditional Chinese Culture Meets a Technical Communication Program

   China},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-51},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article examines specific manifestations of the
   generalizations identified by literature in pedagogy in a Chinese
   university.
   Method: Five open questions were asked of the university's five
   technical communication instructors in a 90-minute focus-group interview
   session to identify the important areas in pedagogy as conditioned by
   Chinese culture. The 300 students were surveyed to reveal their
   understanding of technical communication as it existed in China.
   Features as conditioned by Chinese culture and as manifested in the 300
   students were also identified through my teaching and observing their
   performance in class.
   Results: The five instructors taught the same lessons and the same
   course content determined by the university. They focused on teaching
   professional terms and phrases. They administered examinations
   throughout a semester to help students memorize the terms. The 300
   students generally thought that technical communication was about
   science and technology. The general audience of technical communication,
   for them, was basically their country, and the purpose was to serve
   their country and society. In class, these students often studied
   through collaboration in groups; they memorized almost everything from
   their professor; and they preferred a broad thinking style to tackling
   broad issues.
   Conclusions: Technical communication pedagogy is governed by
   Confucianism and the test-oriented Chinese society. In class, students
   were motivated by the collectivism Chinese culture stresses. Students'
   rote learning approach was influenced by their traditional way of
   learning, and the broad thinking style was a textual mechanism for
   students to complete assignments while upholding patriotism.},

Title = {Exploring Localized Usability Implementation in mHealth App Design for

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {44-63},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study was designed to better understand how mobile health
   applications (mHealth apps) designed in the Global North (GN) are
   perceived as usable, empowering, and persuasive by users, particularly
   healthcare practitioners, in the context of a Global South (GS)
   country.Method: This article employed an online survey of users of a
   mHealth app that was designed and developed in the GN for global use.
   Survey participants included healthcare practitioners from a GS country
   and the survey was administered by snowball sampling method.Results:
   Eighty-three survey responses from healthcare practitioners in Nepal
   were coded into three broad categories: user experience and mHealth
   apps, localized usability and mHealth apps, and persuasive design and
   mHealth apps. Their relationships and connections are examined within
   these categories.Conclusion: From a user empowerment perspective,
   understanding the interest, motivation, and concerns of end-users is
   vital to the development and implementation of mHealth apps, especially
   in the low- and middle-income healthcare contexts in which healthcare
   practitioners have limited resources. Culturally sustaining localized UX
   approaches should be adopted to create usable, empowering, and
   persuasive mHealth apps for use in resource-constrained cultural
   settings in the GS.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Design thinking is a process for identifying solutions to
   problems in certain contexts. The better one understands contextual
   factors affecting use and interaction, the more effectively one can use
   design thinking to address issues at the context and greater systems
   levels. This article examines how the cognitive science concepts of
   scripts and prototypes can help realize the potential of design thinking
   in different settings.
   Method: This article compares design thinking approaches for
   understanding context to concepts of context as examined in the
   cognitive mechanisms of prototypes and scripts. Through this comparison,
   the author explains how to integrate scripts and prototypes into design
   thinking processes in order to enhance understandings of context and the
   success of design thinking approaches to context-related problems.
   Results: The article reveals that prototypes and scripts can expand
   design thinking approaches and enhance the development of design
   solutions for addressing problems at local and greater systems levels.
   Conclusions: Technical communicators can use the approach presented here
   to enhance design thinking processes in order to better address problems
   in or design products for specific contexts.},

Title = {Using Interface Rhetoric to Understand Audience Agency in Natural
   History Apps},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},
Pages = {280-292},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: A wide array of apps is increasingly being developed to provide
   information about natural history and science for users of mobile
   devices. This article discusses how a better understanding of audiences'
   agency as they use natural history apps-i.e., their ability to take
   meaningful action-can help technical communicators develop more
   effective products.
   Method: I use interface rhetoric to examine key considerations of
   audience agency for natural history apps, focusing on five bird
   identification guide apps, part of a technical genre associated with
   historically established-though evolving-use practices. I analyze and
   discuss how the rhetorical choices of developers may empower audiences
   to understand nature or frame their interactions with nature in certain
   ways.
   Results: I identify three overlapping ways these apps function as
   interfaces for users: 1) to frame their audience's experience of and
   relations to a body of natural history knowledge, 2) to model the
   conventions and practices of the birding community, and 3) to frame
   their audience's understanding of the natural world as a whole.
   Conclusion: Approaching natural history guide app design with an
   awareness of the diverse ways in which these texts function as
   interfaces can help technical communicators facilitate different types
   of audience agency during the apps' ultimate situated use.},

Title = {Do Technical/Professional Writing (TPW) Programs Offer What Students
   Need for Their Start in the Workplace? A Comparison of Requirements in
   Program Curricula and Job Ads in Industry},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {223+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This small-scale study investigates the skills and experiences
   most sought-after by recruiters and hiring managers in entry-level
   technical writers in the work place. The purpose is to learn whether
   academic programs offer the course work and opportunities students need.
   Additionally, I discuss job-ad requirements for entry-level technical
   writers in the workplace and compare technical/professional academic
   program offerings with those job-ad requirements.
   Method: Recruiters and hiring managers were surveyed to learn their top
   priorities for skills and experiences. Data from job ads of three job
   boards was gathered and analyzed, and this data was compared to academic
   program requirements across the United States.
   Results: While technical and professional writing programs are
   ever-changing and substantially different, there are similarities, and
   the programs seem to be preparing students well for the workplace.
   Conclusion: Most programs require core courses that are similar in name
   and description and require additional study in an area of expertise or
   a minor. These core curricula align well to the requirements in
   entry-level job ads in the industry. More research is needed to learn
   the best ways students learn in university courses. Additionally, we
   need to investigate the consistency of internship requirements among
   programs and encourage industries to consider internship experience as
   legitimate industry experience.},

Title = {The Image of User Instructions: Comparing Users' Expectations of and
   Experiences with an Official and a Commercial Software Manual},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-49},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The market for (paid-for) commercial software manuals is
   flourishing, while (free) official manuals are often assumed to be
   neglected by users. To investigate differences in user perceptions of
   commercial and official manuals, we conducted two studies: one focusing
   on user expectations and one on user experiences.
   Method: The first study was an online experiment, in which two groups of
   participants answered questions about their expectations of a
   (commercial or official) manual. The second study was a 2x2 experiment,
   with perceived source (commercial or official) and the actual content of
   the instructions (commercial or official) as independent variables, and
   task performance and users' judgments as dependent variables.
   Results: The first study showed that users have different expectations
   of commercial and official manuals, and overall think more positively
   about a commercial manual. The second study showed that perceived source
   had a significant effect on task performance: Participants worked better
   when they thought they used a commercial manual. No differences were
   found regarding participants' judgments of the manual.
   Conclusion: Our research indicates a potential image problem of official
   user manuals. Even though we found no evidence for a lower quality of
   the official manual's content, users' relatively negative expectations
   of an official manual may discourage them from using the official user
   instructions. The second study showed that the perceived source
   (commercial/official) may even affect the actual task performance of
   users.},

Abstract = {Purpose: While research is an important to both academics and
   practitioners alike, it seems the field is currently at an impasse about
   what constitutes research and what questions should be a priority for
   the field. We wanted to give practitioners a forum to provide their
   perspectives on what research is and what questions the field should be
   researching.
   Method: We conducted 30 asynchronous interviews with practitioners, and
   then analyzed the interviews for common themes and topics.
   Results: Interviewees ( practitioners) noted an interest in research
   that examined how individuals ( particularly specific audiences) use
   different technologies as well as an interest in collaborating with
   academics to explore research on different topics and from different
   perspectives.
   Conclusion: The information reported here and the related questions it
   raises can enhance understanding of and facilitate collaboration across
   the field. This study helps industry practitioners of technical
   communication to better understand how other industry practitioners in
   the field view and think of research; it also helps academic researchers
   in technical communication to better understand perspectives,
   assumptions, and expectations industry practitioners have about
   research.},

Title = {What Measures of Productivity and Effectiveness Do Technical
   Communication Managers Track and Report?},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {147-172},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Previous literature focuses on what practitioners should be
   doing to demonstrate the value of technical communication, rather than
   what they actually do. This study addresses the gap by asking managers
   about the extent to which they track two measures of value-productivity
   and effectiveness-as well as the expectations of sponsors for receiving
   reports on these issues.
   Method: A survey of corporate communication, training, and technical
   communication groups was conducted. Participants were recruited through
   local chapters of the STC and the American Medical Writers Association.
   Ninety technical communication managers responded.
   Results: The evidence suggests that activities for tracking productivity
   by technical communication managers are limited. Technical communication
   groups rarely solicit feedback and perceptions on individual
   communication products and employ usability testing on a limited basis.
   Technical communicators rarely track return on investment (ROI).
   Technical communication managers feel limited pressure to report
   productivity and effectiveness. The most significant criteria against
   which the productivity and effectiveness of technical communication
   groups is assessed is word of mouth. The evidence only partially
   supports this entering belief: Customer surveys play an important role
   in assessing general impressions of technical communication products.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with earlier studies and
   suggest that despite a discussion about means of assessing the
   productivity and effectiveness of technical communicators that has
   spanned over a quarter of a century, none of the methods of assessment
   has reached wide use. The study also suggests that perceptions are the
   most significant factor in assessing the value of technical
   communication products and services, and should be given more focus in
   future research and writing on this topic.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Technical communication scholars have shifted to considering
   the role of communication specialists as knowledge workers within larger
   networks, such as work groups, organizations, and institutions. From our
   interest in this trend as well as our aims to bridge workplace and
   classroom contexts, we conducted a case study of the networked
   interactions of key actors involved in iFixit's Technical Writing
   Project, as enacted in a technical writing classroom at a state
   university.
   Method: From Latour's definition of an actor as a component of a network
   capable of impacting other components, we conducted a qualitative case
   study examining the interactions of technical writers, technical writing
   students, technological devices, tools, and wiki technologies during
   students' completion of the Technical Writing Project. In particular, we
   examined how these actors exerted rhetorical impacts on one other during
   students' writing processes.
   Results: The results of our study were that the Technical Writing
   Project asked students to assemble a complex rhetorical situation that
   involved technical knowledge-making as well as assembling both human and
   nonhuman actors to create high-quality documentation. Further, this
   documentation was created in a situation strongly influenced by both
   workplace realities and the interactions enabled by an open source wiki
   that allows for contributions by interested Internet users.
   Conclusion: We believe our study on the reciprocal impacts of both human
   and nonhuman actors in the context of a learning project that spans
   workplace and classroom context calls for new models of rhetoric that
   better account for networked knowledge-making.},

Title = {The Web Portfolios of Independent Technical Communicators ... and the
   Documents of Their Clients},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {217-237},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: This empirical study examines whether independent technical
   communicators' Web portfolios are worthwhile and how technical
   communicators manage to post work for clients on their own Web sites.
   Method: The study surveyed 240 independent contractors, consultants, and
   principals of small businesses that maintain Web sites to market their
   technical communication services, briefly interviewed half of them, and
   analyzed posted samples of their work.
   Results: Results reveal the extent to which posted work samples are
   useful in marketing technical communication services, and how the
   numbers of such samples are associated with their overall usefulness.
   Results also reveal how independent technical communicators overcome
   such challenges as clients' concerns about proprietary information,
   confidentiality, and intellectual property in order to post their work.
   Conclusion: These results carry implications not only for how
   independent technical communicators disseminate a portfolio of their
   work but also for how any technical communicators would develop
   portfolios of their work for employment, academic credentials, or
   professional certification.},

Title = {Technical Communication in the Health Fields: Executive Order 13166 and
   Its Impact on Translation and Localization},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {251-265},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: The ongoing implementation of the tenets of Executive Order
   (EO) 13166 is helping change the focus of localization and writing for
   translation for technical communicators. In this article, I will discuss
   EO 13166; its impact on hospitals, clinics, and limited English
   proficient (LEP) populations; and how technical communicators involved
   in translation and localization help medical professionals comply with
   the law. I will provide best practice strategies for localization
   practices in the health care industry worldwide.
   Method: This article employs a literature review of government
   documentation for Executive Order 13166, as well as hospital and clinic
   reports of current localization practices designed to increase
   compliance with EO 13166.
   Results: The review of current practices indicates that much work
   remains to be done by technical communicators to help hospitals and
   clinics comply with EO 13166, especially in the areas of visual icons
   and other localization efforts.
   Conclusion: The best strategies for localizing health care information
   include the following:
   1. Make the textual style of the information match that of the culture's
   expectations.
   2. Research the preferences for graphics and color in medical documents
   for the target culture and use the preferred style in the documentation.
   3. Use widely recognized symbols.
   4. Use focus groups to test the localization strategy with
   representatives of the target culture.
   5. Consider the content of the documentation when localizing, not just
   the style and format.},

Title = {Copyright Law as Mediational Means: Report on a Mixed Methods Study of
   US Professional Writers},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This article reports on 12 select findings from a sequential
   mixed-methods, empirical study of U. S. educational-context professional
   writers composing for the Web. The study explores the status of
   knowledge and understanding of U. S. copyright law, levels of chilled
   speech, and the use of rhetorical invention in such digital writing
   contexts.
   Method: Research methods include a digital survey receiving 334
   responses from randomly selected students/teachers and discourse-based
   interviews with seven of these participants.
   Results: With respect to authorship, Web writers sometimes occupy
   conflicting positions. Empirical evidence challenges traditional ideas
   of authorship, i.e., a single author working alone in a garret,
   producing texts from his or her sole creative genius. The study finds
   digital writers' speech is not as ``chilled{''} as one might expect, and
   while knowledge of copyright law is important to digital writers, they
   are fairly confident in the knowledge they have. Copyright law is not
   the primary concern of digital writers. As it turns out, ethics trumps
   the law in importance when considering digital composing choices. In the
   area of copyright knowledge, key misunderstandings appeared among
   writers. For example: confusion on (1) the difference between copyright
   and plagiarism, (2) unauthorized use and authorized use, (3) the
   government exception to copyright, and (4) the fact that U. S. copyright
   law protects ``creative{''} work to a higher extent than it protects
   ``factual{''} work.
   Conclusion: The study hopes to provide a methodology for further
   research, and a baseline in the area of knowledge and understanding of
   copyright law as it intersects with invention, among the professional
   writing population.},

Title = {Hashtag \#TechComm: An Overview of Members, Networks, and Themes from
   2016-2019},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study provides a four-year overview of the \#TechComm
   community on Twitter, specifically identifying influential members, key
   networks, and thematic content of tweets. This data provides insight
   into trends, tools, organizations, and events prevalent in the
   \#TechComm community.
   Method: The study reports outcomes of four methods. First, statistical
   analyses were used to analyze 75,333 tweets from the most active 290
   members of the \#TechComm community. Second, profile data from community
   members' profiles were coded per mutually exclusive categories. Third,
   the TAGS Explorer, which uses Google's visualization API, was used to
   explore networks and sub-networks. Finally, a principal components
   analysis was conducted to examine topics and to identify significant
   themes in the tweets.
   Results: Members of the \#TechComm community are diverse, with a
   majority being practitioners. Most members self-identify as technical
   communicators or writers, but other job titles include content
   specialist, software documentation specialist, and manager. Considering
   members' relationships and interactions, data visualization highlighted
   two major networks: academics and practitioners. Among academics, most
   of the conversation was facilitated by a few users. In contrast,
   practitioners participated in smaller sub-networks. In the
   conversations, eight major themes arose from the principal components
   analysis; themes include Adobe, DITA/XML, academic \#TechComm, and STC.
   Conclusion: The study reveals potential areas where the divide between
   practitioners and academics could be bridged; these areas include
   curricular inclusion of DITA/XML and Twitter as a venue for research
   feedback from practitioners.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {365-374},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: Recent changes in health care in the US have made it important
   for health information to become easier to access, understand, and use.
   Making medical decisions without adequate information can lead to poor
   health outcomes. Providers are being incentivized to improve the quality
   and value of patient-centered communication and care. Technical
   communication practitioners can collaborate with interdisciplinary
   professionals to help these initiatives succeed.
   Method: A patient education software application was developed with an
   interdisciplinary collaboration between a medical animation company, a
   surgery clinic, and an academic researcher who is also a technical
   communication practitioner. User-centered design principles were
   employed in the development of the application. Interviews were
   conducted to reveal insights about the application's influence on the
   language participants used to discuss the procedure.
   Results: Participants who used the software application to learn about
   the procedure were able to consistently recognize and recall more
   informational and procedural knowledge than participants who did not use
   the application.
   Conclusion: Collaborations similar to this can enhance the design,
   creation, development, and assessment of technical communication
   materials in patient education settings to help improve the odds that
   patients will understand more about their health and be able to make
   better decisions and can contribute valuable information to the
   technical communication curriculum. Best practices in technical
   communication can inform user-centered design, development, and
   assessment of educational materials in a variety of settings.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-206},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: To examine instructional video as a vernacular form of
   technical communication serving readers unwilling to consult print
   documentation. Provide a set of best practices for creating and
   delivering video based on analysis of existing, highly-rated content on
   YouTube.
   Method: Assessment of a criterion-based (that is, software type) sample
   of 46 instructional videos stratified by user ratings. Inductive coding
   of shared within-group (that is, ``good,{''} `` average,{''} ``poor{''}
   rating) features, including genre conventions, rhetorical work, and
   communication design qualities.
   Results: Good instructional videos share qualities that appear to
   account for their strong user ratings and distinguish them from average
   and poor videos. Good videos spend significant time introducing an
   instructional agenda and forecasting goals and steps. In this manner,
   they function like video equivalents of printed documentation. Good
   videos also focus on demonstrative content, in which steps are both
   performed and explained or elaborated. By contrast, videos with lower
   ratings focus as much or more on simply doing the steps without
   explaining or explaining without doing. Good videos were also designed
   so that their instructional messages could be easily identified and
   accessed, easily understood and applied, and so that the messages were
   engaging and encouraging.
   Conclusions: Designers of instructional video can successfully apply
   lessons learned from the design of instructional content for print while
   taking into account the medium-specific affordances and constraints of
   video and sound. The potential for rapid, viral distribution via social
   media channels should also inform the selection and design of
   instructional content.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine pertinent issues
   regarding the need for a fair use structure in international
   intellectual property agreements.
   Method: The issues in this article were examined using a scholarly
   methodology based on legal research and applied analysis and application
   to the technical communication field.
   Results: The findings are that fair use cannot be employed in
   international intellectual property treaty development because, to
   operate, it must retain its necessary connection to the U. S.
   Constitution's goals and policy.
   Conclusion: International intellectual property law treaty development
   should incorporate humanistic guidelines that accommodate fair use goals
   based on universal rights.},

Title = {Capabilities and Roles of Enterprise Wikis in Organizational
   Communication},
Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-89},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The article alerts technical communicators to wiki technology,
   an emerging new medium that allows dispersed groups to create shared
   content via collaborative editing and different-time communication.
   Wiki-based collaborative content creation enables new communication
   practices and thereby challenges several assumptions of existing media
   choice theories.
   Method: Analysis of empirical evidence from 32 published case
   descriptions and reports to evaluate wiki technology in a corporate
   context based on the defining characteristics of three media choice
   theories (i.e., media richness theory, theory of media synchronicity,
   and common ground theory).
   Results: Wikis meet or exceed capabilities of several other
   communication and collaboration media, and thus provide a credible
   alternative to other business communication technologies currently in
   use. Further, distinct media capabilities of wikis are not fully
   represented by current media choice theories, suggesting the need to
   extend media choice theories to recognize these unique capabilities.
   Conclusion: The unique features of enterprise wikis enable new
   collaboration practices and challenge some of the core theoretical
   assumptions of media choice theories. The refactoring capability of
   wikis is identified as a unique feature that enables new forms of
   collaboration and communication in organizations. An implementation that
   wishes to successfully leverage wiki-enabled collaboration opportunities
   must carefully consider challenges of human interaction such as
   free-riding, or conflict of values.},

Journal = {TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-64},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Companies can improve customer satisfaction while reducing training time
   and product support costs by integrating online documentation with
   product training. Online documentation can be designed to be not only
   the reference at the point of use but also the primary instructional
   medium used during training. This use of the online documentation during
   training increases user acceptance of it and helps develop the required
   skills for its use. This expanded role for online documentation provides
   new opportunities for technical communicators to add value to their
   roles within their companies. This article defines reference-based
   instruction and outlines its benefits. It describes how reference-based
   instruction can be incorporated into an instructional system design
   (ISD) and provides specific examples of learning objectives and student
   exercises. It lists guidelines for how to structure usability tests for
   Help systems, and finally, it advises how technical communicators can
   use reference-based instruction to expand their perceived value in their
   organizations.},
