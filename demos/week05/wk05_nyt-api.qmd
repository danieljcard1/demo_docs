title: "Wk 05: NYT API Data"
---

## Overview

There are lots of APIs. The NYT has a good one we can use to practice. 

## Libraries

I'm using an [R package "nytimes"](https://github.com/news-r/nytimes) to access the API. 

```{r}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("news-r/nytimes")
```

We also need an API key from the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/). 

Sign up for an account, create an app, enable desired parts of the API, and get your API key

```{r}

```
